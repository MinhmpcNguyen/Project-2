It is the central hub of our ecosystem, from which you can interact with and utilize other products such as Trava Lending, Staking, and Governance, as well as those of PancakeSwap. This product aims to help the entire dApp of Trava Finance enhance user convenience and efficiency. To be more specific, Trava Station streamlines your experience by allowing you to combine multiple actions into a single transaction, eliminating the need to switch between dApps and platforms. This not only saves time but also reduces gas fees, making transactions faster and more cost-effective. _The gas fees saved by using Trava Station are significant!_ You can check how much gas fees you can save in the picture and how you can aggregate multiple actions in one transaction below. At present, Trava Station has 6 features: ‚û°Ô∏è Freight: Allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands. ‚û°Ô∏è Tramlines: Provides a list of pre-made shortcuts to do common actions. ‚û°Ô∏è Junction: Allow users to pre-set transactions to be auto-executed when the conditions are met. ‚û°Ô∏è Portfolio: A real-time report that keeps track of all your activities and assets in Trava Station. ‚û°Ô∏è Analytics: Get real-time analysis and personal suggestions based on your assets and preferences to help your decision-making. ‚û°Ô∏è Recommendations: Provide a thorough analysis and prediction of DEXs‚Äô parameters.

For example, you want to withdraw some $BNB from the Trava Lending Pool, and then deposit it in Trava Staking. Instead of doing many steps, you just need to drag and drop the actions and execute them with just 1 click. With Trava Freight, all the laborious, time-consuming, and costly steps on different interfaces can be combined into a single transaction. Currently, Freight has been operating smoothly on Mainnet, however, it mostly only allows basic actions and interactions with Trava Finance's Lending Pools, PancakeSwap, etc. on BNB Chain. We are still continuing to polish the product and develop Freight even more in the future. If you have any suggestions, let us know so the team can check and work on them.

Now, Trava Station does help reduce the time-consuming steps of changing dApps, but you still need to drag and drop from the start again. Or you would have to spend time figuring out which actions are required and in what order. All these operations can be so boring and laborious. Therefore, we would like to introduce Tramlines, a new feature added into Trava Station on October 11, 2023 üëâ https://app.trava.finance/station/tramlines. It provides users with common sets of pre-arranged actions to import, which are called Routes. In each route, the name will be displayed, followed by the description, requirements and so on. Tramlines also estimates the amount of gas needed using Trava Station, then compares it to the amount when performing each action separately like normal. After choosing, now you can edit the amount for each factor in Freight according to your needs. If you have any wanted actions in your mind, feel free to suggest them to us ‚Äî even though the Bug Hunt has ended, Suggestions topic in Trava Forum will continue to be open.

In it, we mentioned the need for a feature so that we can combine various actions in a single transaction ‚Äî Smart Wallet. Utilizing Smart Wallet in Trava Station system However, many people may not understand their fundamental mechanisms and profound benefits, and that is why we have this article. Follow along with the content below to answer questions surrounding Smart Wallet, and clarify the importance of it in the Trava Station system. Unveiling the Smart Wallet At its core, a smart wallet is an advanced digital tool designed to enhance the way we store, manage, and interact with our financial assets. Each smart wallet is created and owned by the user, representing them (their proxy) and ensuring absolute control over its operations. Departing from the standard Web3 wallets, smart wallets eliminate the need for private keys or seed phrases, instead rely on smart contracts. These intricate computer programs run on a blockchain, operate based on predefined rules and conditions. Conditions and access permissions are encoded into these self-executing code, rendering Smart Wallet both secure and adaptable for managing financial resources. Smart Wallet and Trava Station When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create a Smart Wallet. To understand why, we must first look at the essence of Trava Station ‚Äî a transit point for performing actions in one go. Normally, you will have to execute and pay a fee for separate transactions on blockchain, as you cannot perform another action if you have a pending one. In response to that, this upcoming product is intended to reduce both the time you spend switching between Trava platforms, and the fee of making multiple transactions. With Trava Station, your assets will be put into Smart Wallet to be evaluated according to the sequences of actions and parameters you set. It now acts as an intermediary so that the requests of the users can be calculated and fulfilled in one go, making the experience much smoother. While using Trava Station, your assets will be temporarily held in Smart Wallet, then returned to your Main Wallet (Metamask, Trust Wallet,‚Ä¶) after the process is over.",

For example, when you create an action with Freight in Trava Station to sell Armoury items, the money won‚Äôt immediately go into your Smart Wallet. The NFT will stay there until someone buys it on the Marketplace, at which point the process ends and now your Smart Wallet will hold the money from that sale. Trava Station‚Äôs Smart Wallet allows users to create their own routes to execute actions within and between Trava Finance protocols efficiently, particularly with Freight. In addition, there are pre-made routes that you can import from Tramlines to freely use. Smart Wallet also supports storing pre-set rules for specific conditions, which best shows in Junction. This feature includes sequences that won‚Äôt run right when you create them, but will be triggered by the system bot when a condition is reached. You can also track all the assets in your Smart Wallet in the Portfolio section of Trava Station. This feature will display your position in the Lending Pool when you use Smart Wallet to perform actions in the pools in the Trava ecosystem. Or as with the example mentioned above ‚Äî you create an order to sell Armoury items, Portfolio will display those NFTs for sale, and the amount of money you have in your Smart Wallet. Pervasive Benefits of Smart Wallets Smart Wallet is absolutely necessary for Trava Station to work. It provides a smoother DeFi experience by allowing users to combine several transactions into one, minimizing the fee of performing multiple actions at the same time, and so on. Smart Wallet brings more convenient experience while still offering enhanced security, satisfying not only new users but also experienced ones. Thanks to the versatility of smart contracts, it can break user reliance on private keys, offer advantageous new features and provide a better experience. In their development, Smart Wallets also presented a number of other uses, such as allowing multisig transactions, or extra layer of security through authenticating apps. They are also capable of limiting daily transaction amounts, reducing the possibility of costly errors and stopping attackers from emptying your wallet. These are all potential benefits of Smart Wallet that can be applied to Trava Station, which have been looked into and / or currently being developed by the Trava team. Conclusion Smart Wallet marks a pivotal juncture in our journey, offering heightened security and streamlined accessibility for Trava Station. We stand poised to significantly enhance your DeFi experience, formulating an effective ecosystem amidst this evolving landscape. With the release of this product, Trava Finance looks forward to bringing you the most convenience, minimizing costs and time for users‚Äô transactions. üåüSo let‚Äôs countdown to Trava Station launch on August 24, 2023 . About Trava.Finance Trava Finance is the world‚Äôs first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, Trava Finance offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. Trava Finance is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks.

    "text": "2024 Overview of Trava Finance Ecosystem: Published in 5 min readAug 28, 2024 Share In the ever-growing process, Trava has introduced many new products and updates in 2024, such as TravaGPT, Trava Station, etc. To help you easily navigate through our current ecosystem, we provide a detailed overview of Trava Finance in 2024. The overview of Trava ecosystem At present, Trava Finance aims to become an AI-driven Lending Station that provides cross-chain lending pools and other financial services, empowered by AI technology and automation. With that being said, we want to bring users the most convenience in the DeFi space and complete decentralization in Web3. Currently, there are 6 major products in Trava Finance: 1Ô∏è‚É£ TravaGPT : An AI chatbot of Trava. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Trava Station : A hub that brings together the short ways to use all Trava products. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Wallet: an advanced crypto wallet for Web3 users. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Trava Lending Market : A marketplace protocol providing user-owned lending pools. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Trava Staking : A staking protocol to deposit $TRAVA, $rTRAVA or $BNB to earn interest. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Trava Governance : A governance system, allowing users to vote for major decisions of Trava. Let‚Äôs dive into our ecosystem in this article! TravaGPT TravaGPT is an AI chat tool developed by Trava team that helps enhance user experience and navigate our DeFi products more easily. After a process of development, TravaGPT has reached version 3.0 , incorporating more powerful functions than a mere chatbot. With TravaGPT, you just need to tell it what you want to know or to do, it will provide you not only useful information but also complete the actions for you. Currently, it has 3 major features: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ask anything in Web3 2Ô∏è‚É£ Talk anywhere on Trava 3Ô∏è‚É£ Support DeFi actions in pools or vaults on Trava Finance Feature highlights of TravaGPT TravaGPT will soon be available on Telegram, a popular platform among Web3 enthusiasts. By expanding to Telegram, we aim to offer users a more convenient way to access TravaGPT and a more user-friendly interface. Trava Station Trava Station serves as a center of Trava Finance, aiming to help users in the Trava ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving them time and money when making transactions. With Trava Station, instead of having to move between dApps and platforms to perform actions, you can combine them all together in one transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time and gas costs compared to when doing separate actions. Let‚Äôs see how you can aggregate multiple actions in one transaction and how much gas fees you can save in the picture below. Save more with Trava Station At present, Trava Station has 6 features: ‚û°Ô∏è Freight : Allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands. ‚û°Ô∏è Tramlines : Provides a list of pre-made shortcuts to do common actions. ‚û°Ô∏è Junction : Allow users to pre-set transactions to be auto-executed when the conditions are met. ‚û°Ô∏è Portfolio : A real-time report that keeps track of all your activities and assets in Trava Station. ‚û°Ô∏è Analytics : Get real-time analysis of the market as well as user preference in Trava Finance. ‚û°Ô∏è Recommendations : Provide a thorough analysis and prediction of DEXs‚Äô parameters. Smart Wallet Smart Wallet is an advanced digital tool that relies on smart contracts, which are only created and owned by the user. Setting apart from other normal wallets, it eliminates the need for private keys or seed phrases. Using a smart wallet offers more advantages for users: * Save fees and streamline transaction process : They enable a smoother DeFi experience by combining multiple transactions into one, reducing transaction fees. * Enhanced user experience and privacy : Smart Wallets offer convenience while improving security, appealing to both new and experienced users by utilizing smart contracts to reduce dependence on private keys. * Additional features and security : Smart Wallets can support multi-signature transactions, add extra layers of security through app authentication, limit daily transaction amounts, and prevent potential errors or theft. Smart Wallet is incorporated in Trava Station and TravaGPT to optimize DeFi actions for users in Trava Finance. Specifically, with Trava Station, your assets are temporarily moved to a Smart Wallet to execute all your actions in a single transaction, making the process smoother. After the actions are completed, your assets are returned to your main wallet (like Metamask or Trust Wallet). To have your own Smart Wallet, you just need to connect your wallet to Trava Finance and go to the Freight tab of Trava Station to create it. Trava Lending Market This is the first lending market that allows users to not only deposit, and borrow assets, but also create and manage their own lending pools. Trava lending system consists of the Trava lending pool and 7 user-owned pools. Trava pool supports around 10 types of assets across 2 different blockchains ( BSC and Ethereum ), while the user-owned pools offer limitless possibilities based on user creativity and specific needs. The lending pools on Trava Lending Market Trava Staking This is a staking protocol that allows users to deposit Trava Finance‚Äôs tokens ($TRAVA/ $rTRAVA) and BNB Chain‚Äôs token ($BNB). Users will then receive corresponding rewards based on their deposit and annual percentage rate (APR) of the staking vaults. Currently, there are three available vaults in Trava Staking which are shown in the picture below. The available staking vaults of Trava Finance Trava Governance Trava Finance also aims to apply the DAO model to the entire system with , which allows users to propose and vote on changes to the ecosystem. Users can stake their TRAVA, rTRAVA, TRAVA/BNB for a period of time and receive veTRAVA ‚Äî voting power, which can be exchanged on veTRAVA Marketplace. The mechanism of Trava Governance ** About Trava.Finance ** Trava Finance is the world‚Äôs first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending, currently on the way to become an AI-driven Lending Station. We provide both lending pools like normal approaches, and a more flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own pools.

    "text": "TRAVA FINANCE: ROADMAP FOR 2024: Published in 5 min readNov 9, 2023 Share It‚Äôs November 2023 now, another year is about to pass with various milestones that Trava Finance has achieved with our community. But there is still a lot to do on the journey of becoming a Decentralized Lending Marketplace waiting ahead, especially with the rapid development of technology today. To give Trava Knights a thorough look into the future plan of Trava Finance for 2024, we have created this Roadmap. The Final Quarter of 2023 In the fourth quarter of 2023, Trava Finance had plans to release Tramlines for Trava Station , and already successfully executed it. This feature offers various preset Routes of most common actions in the Trava ecosystem, enabling users to perform investment strategies much faster and easier. Our next addition is Web3 Portfolio , which will allow users to have full control over their current DeFi assets and lending position. This feature can be said to be an upgraded and consolidated version of our dApps, giving users a unified view of their portfolio, making it easier to track and manage their investments. We will also introduce Lending Analytics ‚Äî it will provide powerful views for users about lending protocols on the market, including finance and user aspects. This feature allows you to track your lending position, performance, and other data, giving detailed insights into lending activities of end users to help empower our AI model. The First Quarter of 2024 At the beginning of 2024, Trava Team will put a lot of effort into launching Trava Junction , the final feature in Station that allows users to create transactions in advance that only automatically execute when a preset condition(s) is met. We will release Ver. 1 of Junction in the first quarter, with the Monitoring User Position function. Trava Team has also been making preparations from now to launch User Portfolio and Position Alerts ‚Äî to further enhance user experience. In general, they are two tools that will help you monitor more closely your personal data and lending positions, thereby staying on top of your investment game and making timely decisions. Another crucial milestone in the first Quarter of 2024 will be the release of Lending Recommendation by AI , with the first step being Protocols Suggestion . This is the place where BRicher and Trava Station meet each other ‚Äî Based on your portfolio, Bricher will recommend the potential and suitable lending actions for users. The Second Quarter of 2024 In the following Quarter, we will be building on the success of our previous releases with some updates. First is Tramlines Suggestion for Trava Station, an addition to Lending Recommendation by AI . With this, a new era of Trava ecosystems will be fully set in, and new opportunities in the community are going to be established. In the same Quarter, we will be introducing Trends Alerts and News Capturing . The former will aggregate all news related to lending pools and provide to our Users. Meanwhile, the latter will alert users when there is anyone on chain trends relevant to lending protocols to users. In the second quarter of 2024, users can also experience Ver. 2 of Trava Junction , now added with Automating User Actions to make user financial experience more seamless and efficient. With this development, our AI-driven system will analyze and evaluate aggregated data, from which to choose and perform the most appropriate actions for you under your permission. The Third Quarter of 2024 For the latter half of the following year, we have planned some exciting new features and updates for our users. In general, Trava Finance will focus quite a bit on upgrading different aspects of Trava Station , especially applying Generative AI in its ecosystem. We will strive to expand the availability of Trava Apps, which will bring users an even more secure, smooth, and exciting experience in DeFi. Trava Team will carry out the Trava Junction for Pool Creation , which gives users more control and flexibility over their investment decisions in the Trava ecosystem. Two other features are more closely related to Tramlines, the former of which is an update of Lending Recommendation with Tramlines creation by AI . The other is Personalized Tramlines by AI , which will provide users with relevant and customized financial recommendations based on their financial history and credit score. The Fourth Quarter of 2024 We have some cutting-edge technology planned for our users to experience in the final quarter of 2024. Our TramlinesGPT and JunctionGPT will be the most direct results of the AI technology developed by Trava Finance. These features will enable conditional interaction between the users and Trava Station, utilizing natural language processing and machine learning to give users the best answers and suggestions. Conclusion The year 2023 has seen some downs, but the important thing is that we continue to grow strongly, and closer to the goal of Decentralized Lending Marketplace. 2024 is predicted to be the year of potential opportunities for Trava Finance and the crypto market, with the content of the Station Roadmap mentioned above. So stay tuned with the Trava Finance community to have the latest news of the journey! About Trava.Finance Trava Finance is the world‚Äôs first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, Trava Finance offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.

TCV is developing as an AI platform enabling liquidity strategies provision for DeFi on DEX V3 & Lending pool on multi-chains. At present, the platform provides 5 pools on Arbitrum 1 , corresponding to those of Uniswap . üìå More importantly, only when providing liquidity on TCV vaults, users can maximize their liquidity with our optimized APR and manage their liquidity in an automated, capital-efficient, non-custodial, and transparent manner. üåü Now, here are the pools that have the best APR optimized on TCV platform üëâ You can take a closer look at these pools and join them: Second Question: Your project already has a clear tokenomics for your native token ‚Äî $TCV, right?

Our current plan for this token focuses on two main objectives: Governance and Fee Payments within the Protocol. üìç The total supply of $TCV is capped at 168 million tokens, with an initial market cap of $200,000 . The tokens will be distributed across seven categories shown in the tokenomics below. üî• Especially, the Early Seed Round of $TCV, part of the Seed Sale, represents just 0.1% of the total supply, offering an exclusive opportunity to purchase $TCV at an optimal price.‚Äù üìç Additionally, the $TOD treasury will be recognized as part of the tokens sold in the Private Sale round for $TCV, ensuring that the rights of $TOD holders are fully protected. Mechanism and instructions for purchasing TCV Third Question: TCV‚Äôs Early Seed Round for Trava Finance was kicked off yesterday! What is the objective of this event?

    "text": "X Questions: First Question ‚Äî : Could you elaborate on the strategic reasons behind TCV‚Äôs decision to partner with Trava for this Early Seed Round? How does this partnership align with TCV‚Äôs goals and vision for its native token, $TCV? Since the launch of TCV, we‚Äôve maintained a strong connection with the Trava community, and we want to offer the first opportunities to Trava enthusiasts. In this Early Seed Round, anyone involved in the Trava community or using Trava products will have the chance to purchase $TCV at the best possible price. Notably, $TCV is already showing significant growth potential. We believe that the Early Seed Round for the Trava community will pave the way for a successful listing of $TCV. Second Question ‚Äî : I have been participating in Trava for a long time. So how do I qualify to buy? In this Early Seed Round, anyone who joins the Trava community or uses Trava products can buy $TCV at the best price ever: ‚ö°Ô∏è $0.14 ‚ö°Ô∏è Meanwhile, the listing price is $0.34 üöÄ Third Question ‚Äî : How does TCV plan to manage the transition from the Early Seed Round to the public listing of $TCV? What are the key milestones and timelines involved in this transition process? After this early sale, we definitely keep investing efforts and finance sources in TCV products and brand awareness to ensure the growth of the project. We believe this is the core value of the $TCV token, ensuring the safety of buyers who put their trust in us. That being said, we target to achieve a great number of users and expand our partnership to wider Web3 communities, before listing $TCV. And this process is accelerating, so stay tuned! Especially, this Early Seed Sale has sold almost half of $TCV volume within just 1 day! This is a good sign for the potential of $TCV token.",

    "text": "Telegram Questions: : The report highlights that 64.2% of Trava Finance users are returning users accessing the DApp directly. What initiatives are in place to convert new users and expand the user base, particularly through improved marketing strategies on social channels? Mr. Thang Nguyen: Yes, you are right. This is a very important traction on Trava Finance Ecosystem meaning loyal Users trust our application. As you may know, we recently partnered with Centic to explore the potential of our Users and Ecosystem. Centic supports us in having a good view of the market, and competitors and supports us in targeting new Users and Partners. Besides, by the statistics of Centic, we have a good view of marketing activities to attract new users. Each tweet, quest campaign, and announcement will have a performance evaluation to support us have a better plan to go out with our Users. Let‚Äôs come and have a good look at the Growth of Trava Ecosystem: : With the growing adoption of TravaGPT within the platform, what are the potential risks and challenges that may arise from increasing reliance on AI-driven automation for on-chain actions? How does Trava Finance intend to proactively address these challenges to ensure a secure, trustworthy, and seamless user experience? Mr. Minh Nguyen: Surely, TravaGPT will become one of two ways for users to interact with our app in the future. The other way is Trava Station with Account Abstraction. Hence, TravaGPT will become frequently used within the platform. We also try to extend the support of TravaGPT on other chat platforms like Telegram to help users reduce the users effort when using lending pools (Trava lending pool, and others). Related to the risk, I would say there are no risks because all application logic is on the contracts. GPT is the only gateway (aka a smart interface) to call the app logic. Risk management is associated with a Data analytics function (AI-driven) to make the whole system smatter and smatter. The intelligence will eliminate risks and bring profits to users.",

    "text": "Twitter Questions: : The introduction of Trava Station in September 2023 aimed to centralize navigation through the Trava Ecosystem. How has this feature impacted user engagement and interaction with the various products and services offered by Trava Finance, and what metrics highlight its success? Mr. Minh Nguyen: Firstly, let‚Äôs talk about the impact of Trava Station on user engagement and interaction. Station serves as a connecting center, providing short ways for users to create transactions on Trava products such as lending pools, staking vaults, governance vault, etc. Therefore, users no longer need to waste time doing multiple steps in a pool/ vault, instead, just do everything quickly at Trava Station. As I typed above, the Station is one of two ways to interact with Trava Dapp in the future (and TravaGPT is the second way). Moreover, Trava Station also provides many useful services to elevate users experience: * Trava Freight: Allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands. * Trava Junction: Allow users to pre-set transactions to be auto-executed when the conditions are met. * Portfolio: A real-time report that keeps track of all your activities and assets in Trava Station. * For the Portfolio, we will cooperate with Centic.io to exploit on-chain data and even off-chain data. * Analytics and Recommendations: Get real-time analysis and personal suggestions based on your assets and preferences to help your decision-making. With these features, Trava Station makes it easy and efficient for users to interact with Trava‚Äôs products, driving deeper engagement with Trava Finance. With the first interaction way (I mean Trava Station), the users do not need to know much about the complex of Blockchain, lending, and dex‚Ä¶. but they still can do a lot of things with our Station. They still have much more control and power to cook their Defi recipes if they want or let them automatically based on AI. Secondly, regarding the success of Trava Station, our recent performance report showed that most of the transactions created on Trava Finance come from the Station. This highlights the strong support and positive reception from our users for this product. : What will the future of Trava Finance‚Äôs AI Chatbot ‚Äî Trava GPT be like? Will there be any new features or updates? Mr. Minh Nguyen: This year we focus mainly on AI, hence, we are trying to bring more features based on AI. And at present, for the AI Chatbot ‚Äî we have TRAVAGPT. With the product, we are implementing a Telegram bot that enables users to chat on Telegram but can interact with the lending pool of Trava. I think this is a unique feature. There are no chatbot solutions can do that right now. Besides, we are also integrating gathering blockchain news feature to the Telegram chat bot. It means, if you add the bot to your Telegram, we can get the summarized news on blockchain market in the form of short new on your chat everyday. With the news, we also provide some analyses and point out the investment opportunities. You can thus make the Defi actions (borrow, lend, repay, swap, ‚Ä¶) on Telegram Windows chat directly. Imagine, you can through chat windows do everything with Defi. This is our vision, plan, and roadmap for the year of AI 2024! Please try our TravaGPT: https://app.trava.finance/gpt : Trava Finance‚Äôs Bug Bounty program offers valuable rewards for identifying issues related to UI, logical flow, and security. How does this initiative align with Trava‚Äôs commitment to platform improvement, and what steps are being taken to ensure that feedback from this program is effectively incorporated into future updates? Mr. Thang Nguyen: Yeah, that‚Äôs a great question. As you know, Trava has a huge ecosystem with a wide range of applications. We have a lending marketplace, Trava GPT, NFT, Station, and analytics, ‚Ä¶. All of them are complex and have a high level of technical. It took a long time for each development step and ensure the quality of products. And yeah, after the initial development, this Bug Bounty is a way for us to commit to sustainable development, and decentralization, and ensure the quality of products. As the Trava team keeps updating the products with new features and cutting-edge technologies, thorough testing and inspection are crucial to ensure true quality and bring the best experience to our Users. There‚Äôs no better way to achieve this than wide-scale public testing; thus, we hold a Bug Bounty Program, inviting everyone to help identify any problems with Trava products. In this way, the decentralization is enhanced, allowing users to contribute to product development. In the future, as Minh shares our vision, a lot of features will be released to complete our ecosystem, and the bug bounty will be one of the important parts of the development plan. To ensure the quality of the feedback in this program, we provide detailed information with clear RULES, NOTES & DISCLAIMER. üëâ Please check them HERE and follow them exactly. Discuss the Present Product of Trava First Question: Currently, Trava has updated and introduced many new features. To make it easier for users to navigate through our products, could you give us a short overview of Trava Finance, please Mr. Minh? Mr. Minh Nguyen: Let‚Äôs define Trava again: Trava Finance is an AI-driven Lending Station. The meaning of Station is ‚Äúa gateway for users to connect and use any lending pools‚Äù . Starting with the lending and staking section, now we‚Äôve developed it with many utilities. Currently, Trava Finance has 5 main products: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Trava Lending Market : A marketplace protocol for cross-chain lending. Our lending system combines the Trava lending pool and user-owned pools, offering users opportunities to deposit, borrow assets, or create and manage their pools. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Trava Staking : A staking protocol to deposit $TRAVA, $rTRAVA or $BNB to earn interest. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Trava Governance: A system of DAO (decentralized automated organization). It empowers users to govern Trava Finance by providing them with decision-making power. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Trava Station : A hub that brings together the short ways to use all Trava products, helping users to have a seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. 5Ô∏è‚É£ TravaGPT : An AI chatbot letting users ask for Web3 information and perform various DeFi actions in simple daily conversations. We‚Äôll continue to update Trava with the latest trending technology, so stay tuned with us for upcoming developments! Second Question: Trava has just launched a Bug Bounty Program, which may seem a little bit mechanical and require IT knowledge. To make the game easier, could you give some suggestions for the community, Mr. Thang? Mr. Thang Nguyen: People always think Bug Bounty is a difficult game, however, in Trava Finance version, it‚Äôs actually just a piece of cake. Because the objective of this Bug Bounty is to invite the community to join a hand in strengthening Trava Finance, the program is set with straightforward rules: üó° If you find any bugs related to the User interface (UI), Logical Flow, and Security, please let us know with a detailed description üó°. The bug can be realized easily by anyone, even non-IT people. To make it easier for you to understand, let‚Äôs go through some examples of each bug type: ‚û°Ô∏è User interface (UI): * Broken or Misaligned Buttons: Buttons are not properly aligned or are overlapping with other elements, making them difficult to click or use. * Invisible Text: Text is the same color as the background, making it impossible to read. * Elements Not Scaling Properly on Different Devices: The design does not adapt to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile vs. desktop ‚Äî Macos, Windows, ‚Ä¶), causing elements to look distorted or disappear. ‚Ä¶ ‚û°Ô∏è Logical Flow: * Incorrect Calculation Results: The app performs incorrect calculations or logic processing. * Incorrect Date or Time Logic: The countdown system of the vault is wrong or the scheduling system allows users to choose the date/time in the past. ‚Ä¶ ‚û°Ô∏è Security Issue * Insufficient Authorization Checks: The app does not properly check user permissions, allowing users to access or perform actions they shouldn‚Äôt be able to. * Smart contract vulnerability. There are a lot of cases of the issues that can be found on the bug bounty program, although our quality assurance is working hard. Third Question: Now let‚Äôs recap what has Trava achieved so far in 2024 before moving on. Please Mr. Minh, do you have anything to share? Mr. Minh Nguyen: Yes, the overview roadmap, I have just mentioned above, now we have the concrete plan. By August 2024, Trava has witnessed strong growth in product development and active community campaigns. In terms of Trava products, we‚Äôve introduced some outstanding features and updates: * Trava Station has been completed: Routes for most actions in tramlines, token transferring in Freight, History & Manage sections, and auto swap in Junction, analysis in Recommendation. * The beginning of 2024 marked the initiation of TravaGPT. Over half of the year, it has grown rapidly to V3.0, supporting both Web3 questions and DeFi actions on Trava Finance. Here you can see the news summarization. * autoCompound Staking was launched to help automate the process of re-staking your rewards from Trava Vault for compound benefits. Regarding community campaigns, Trava successfully attracted many participants in prominent events: * TravaGPT V3.0‚Äôs Incentive Campaign kicked off with greater rewards than ever. * The Thread Contest has attracted an impressive number of participants. * Successful programs in the partnership with Centic: -> Referral Event -> Reputation Showcase I think we have many things to share, and discuss around the features and event! Information about Upcoming Activities and Product Releases Fourth Question: 2024 still has 1/3 left. So will Trava round out the year with exciting new product launches, Mr. Thang? Mr. Thang Nguyen: Yeah sure, Our team is always delivering new things. We have a good team in terms of research and product development. It will not be only on BNB Chain and Ethereum but also on other ecosystems, like Arbitrum, or TON, maybe. Let‚Äôs wait for the next big thing, very promising! Fifth Question: Could you provide more details about the future development of TravaGPT? Trava is placing a strong emphasis on this product, Please Mr. Minh. Mr. Minh Nguyen: TravaGPT is on the way for massive updates! It‚Äôs the main target of us now. By the end of this year, we‚Äôll be launching a Telegram version of TravaGPT, offering users real-time support anytime, anywhere. This will make TravaGPT even more accessible and responsive. In the far future, we expect to enhance the intelligence of TravaGPT, allowing it to give precise recommendations and predictions for each user. Of course, news summarization is also another important feature of TravaGPT in the next months. As I said, TravaGPT is one of the two ways to interact with Trava Dapp in the near future! Sixth Question: What about marketing and media activities? Do you have any plans for the rest of 2024? Mr. Thang Nguyen: Well, Trava is on track for marketing initiatives in the 3rd and 4th quarters of this year.

    "text": "AMA RECAP ‚Äî UNLOCK TRAVAGPT V3.0‚ÄôS INCENTIVE CAMPAIGN: Published in 8 min readJul 5, 2024 Share On July 2nd, 2024, Trava Finance organized an AMA on to discuss the development of TravaGPT and the incentive campaign of this product ‚Äú Easy Integration, Abundant Rewards ‚Äù. With the honored presence of Mr. Duke Nash, Tech Lead of TravaGPT, this AMA meeting has led attendees to dive into the product TravaGPT and its incentive program. The event was hosted by Ms. Tilly, Community Mod, and covered 3 main sections: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Information about TravaGPT V3.0. 2Ô∏è‚É£ The ongoing incentive program for TravaGPT. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Answers community questions. Let‚Äôs go through the discussions in this AMA event in this article. Information about TravaGPT V3.0 First Question: We can see that Trava Finance is increasingly pushing AI chatbot ‚Äî TravaGPT. So can you introduce this product to new users and explain its significance in Trava ecosystem to everyone, please? For those who are new here, TravaGPT is an AI chatbot that helps enhance user experience and lets you navigate DeFi more easily. This product has been launched in Trava Finance since the beginning of 2024, and as of now, it has developed almost completely. As the world is focusing on AI technology to unlock more potential benefits, Trava Finance also looks ahead to apply advanced technology in our product to provide an unlimited user experience. TravaGPT is born with the mission to become a personal assistant in blockchain investment in Trava ecosystem. That means, you just need to ask TravaGPT to do everything in our ecosystem. The flow will be streamlined from users -> TravaGPT -> Trava Finance. Second Question: TravaGPT has undergone many major upgrades to reach the current version V3.0. So what is special about TravaGPT V3.0? Well, TravaGPT has entered Version V3.0, which integrates with Smart Wallet and automates popular actions on Trava Finance. At present, you can ask TravaGPT to do actions in Trava Finance with Smart Wallets as follows: ‚û°Ô∏è Lending Pools: Deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw. ‚û°Ô∏è Trava Staking: Stake, withdraw, claim reward. ‚û°Ô∏è Trava governance: Create lock, increase amount, increase unlock time, withdraw, merge, compound. When you try this version, you can see significant improvement in experience: ‚úÖ Provides real-time information for tokens, defi applications ‚úÖ Easily execute transactions within Trava ecosystem by natural language, saving time since users don‚Äôt need to go through each application to execute the corresponding transactions Especially, we have updated a mini assistant in TravaGPT to help quick transfer between your wallet and smart wallet. üëâ So don‚Äôt forget to give it a try: https://app.trava.finance/gpt Third Question: I think that many users are waiting for more improvement and benefits of TravaGPT. So do you have any plans for future development of TravaGPT? In the future, we‚Äôll come up with advanced features for TravaGPT: üëâ Collect and analyze real-time news in the blockchain industry to provide deeper insights üëâ Customize recommendations using the user‚Äôs assets for a personalized experience Everything is waiting ahead, so stay tuned with us for a greater experience! The ongoing incentive program for TravaGPT Fourth Question: Currently, Trava is running an incentive program for TravaGPT V3.0. Could you please share with us the objective for this campaign? The official name of TravaGPT V3.0‚Äôs incentive program is ‚ÄúEasy Integration, Abundant Rewards‚Äù This campaign plays an important role in perfecting TravaGPT. It aims to help users get used to the new updates of our chatbot and provide them with real benefits. After the campaign, we hope that Trava users will adopt a handy way of using Trava products: ‚ö° ask TravaGPT to do actions in Trava Finance ‚ö° Fifth Question: So how can we participate in this campaign and are there any notices to keep in mind? To join TravaGPT V3.0‚Äôs incentive campaign, you need to have 2 things: 1. TravaGPT using permission Anyone who holds $5 Trava/vTrava/rTrava/staked Trava/staked rTrava can use TravaGPT: https://app.trava.finance/gpt ** 2. A Smart Wallet: Create your smart wallet here if you haven‚Äôt had it yet: https://app.trava.finance/station Next, you just need to do a simple thing: asking TravaGPT to deposit/ stake with Smart Wallet in Trava Finance lending pool/ Trava Staking and Trava Finance. ‚ö†Ô∏è Especially, remember to ensure this NOTE: When you stake/ deposit in Trava pools/vaults, you‚Äôll have your own APR reward and PLUS 20% of the APR. HOWEVER: ‚úÖ Leaving the reward in the vault until the campaign ends, you will earn an extra 20% APR. ‚ùå Withdrawing the reward before the campaign ends, you will NOT receive that extra 20% APR. Sixth Question: Many users are still confused a little bit about the Rewards of the campaign, especially the 20% APR PLUS. Could you give us a clear explanation for those rewards? The 20% APR PUS means that you will have an additional 20% of the APR you have when depositing/staking in Trava pool/vault. To make things simple, I will give you the formula for this reward: APR + (20% * APR) ** For example, when you stake tokens in Trava Staking and have 4.5% APR. In this campaign, you will not only have that 4.5% APR but also an additional 20% of that APR, which is 0.9% Remember that you also have Extra Rewards and Lottery Rewards, alongside the 20% APR PLUS. üëâ So let‚Äôs join us and get yourself in this LEADERBOARD: Answers community questions The AMA also provided insightful answers to the community‚Äôs questions on Twitter and during the event on Telegram.",

What specific features does TravaGPT V3.0 offer to users, and how does it streamline interactions across different DeFi protocols on the TRAVA platform?‚Äù Because I‚Äôve provided the information that covered the question ‚ÄòWhat specific features does TravaGPT V3.0 offer to users?‚Äù. So I‚Äôll answer the rest. TravaGPT V3.0 introduces advanced features designed to enhance the user experience within the TRAVA ecosystem, especially in navigating decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and streamlining interactions across various DeFi protocols on the TRAVA platform: ‚úÖ Execute DeFi applications using natural language. ‚úÖ Access everything in one place without needing to visit individual applications to perform transactions. : ‚ÄúHow are rewards on the leaderboard calculated? Can you give more information about the lottery prize?‚Äù Firstly, regarding the leaderboard, it displays the rewards users have earned after converting from the 20% APR PLUS. You can take a look at the formula I‚Äôve mentioned to understand how it is calculated: APR + (20% * APR)‚Äù Secondly, regarding the Lotter prize, this is a reward that will be distributed randomly to lucky winners. But only participants in this campaign (who appear on the Leaderboard) can join this Lottery. : ‚ÄúHow can I claim rewards using TravaGPT in Trava Staking? and What are the advantages of using TravaGPT for governance actions in Trava?‚Äù To claim rewards in Trava Staking, you just need to enter TravaGPT and type the order: ‚ÄúI want to claim rewards in Trava Staking‚Äù TravaGPT will provide you with a form like this to let you give more details of the order. With just a few clicks, TravaGPT will automatically complete the transactions for you.

Trava Team‚Äôs experience at Token2049 Embarking on a journey to the Token2049 Conference in Dubai was not without its challenges for Trava Finance. The skies were cloudy, the rain poured heavily, and transportation snags plagued attendees. My flight endured a two-hour delay before landing due to bad weather, followed by a lengthy wait for a taxi as no public transportation was working. Despite these setbacks, what awaited at Token2049 was beyond our expectations. Dubai, with its rapidly growing infrastructure and crypto-friendly regulations, proved to be an ideal host for this gathering of crypto enthusiasts. The resilience of attendees amidst adverse weather conditions showcased the community‚Äôs spirit and determination. Even with the city facing its worst rains in dozens of years, the Token2049 event proceeded smoothly, highlighting the organizers‚Äô efficiency and dedication. The conference hall buzzed with excitement as participants delved into discussions on Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, blockchain innovations, market fluctuations, and Dubai‚Äôs emergence as a hub for crypto ventures. Token2049 was a melting pot of creativity and ingenuity, with attendees presenting groundbreaking ideas spanning AI-blockchain integration, DeFi innovations, and hybrid financial applications. Trava team took advantage of this opportunity to meet face-to-face with many interesting and creative people, united by a shared passion for blockchain‚Äôs transformative potential. In-person connections and relationships are truly key to success. While social media platforms like Twitter and Telegram offer avenues for exchange, nothing can replace the authenticity of human interaction ‚Äî the firm handshake, the warm embrace, the laughter shared over drinks, as well as on-the-spot questions & answers. Thanks to these diverse talks with great minds, we have also gained significant benefits, becoming more certain about our previously made decisions and coming up with new ideas for the development of Trava Finance.

This tool has been and will continue to be a gateway that allows users to conduct all transactions on DeFi, not just limited to Trava Ecosystem.

    "text": "VISION OF TOD: THE FUTURE OF TRAVA CAPITAL: Published in 4 min readMar 15, 2024 Share This article introduces Trava Finance‚Äôs vision for TOD tokens, as well as our plans for Trava Capital in the bull trend of the market. Vision of TOD: The Future of Trava Capital is an important pillar of our ecosystem, helping in the plan to implement various blockchain and crypto investment strategies for the benefit of the whole community. With the market gradually improving and Trava Finance orienting itself as an AI-driven lending station, Trava Capital must also step up to keep up with these grand developments. TOD holders play an important role in this mechanism, leading to concern for its future in particular, and Trava Capital as a whole in general. Continue reading below to learn about our plans for 2024 and beyond. TOD TOD is the reserve currency of Trava Capital, and as you may remember, it has been launched in a token pair before ‚Äî TOD/BUSD. It has also gone through impressive periods of excellence with outstanding results, bringing many benefits to holders. However, with the changing market and the gradual loss of popularity of BUSD over time, Trava Team has a proposal for its future. We intend to cancel the listing for TOD/BUSD, and switch to another pair, which is TOD/USDT. With Listing Liquidity still remaining over $100K, Trava Finance hopes that this will not be a difficult change. It would be even better if TRAVA/TOD Listing Liquidity Call could achieve the number that our team is looking for, prompting the listing of this pair to also be carried out accordingly. Trava Capital As the crypto market rides the bullish wave, opportunities abound for projects like Trava Finance to capitalize on the favorable market conditions. In particular, Trava Capital is in a prime position in the ongoing trend, with its focus on optimizing capital investment and benefiting its stakeholders. That‚Äôs why finding a smart mechanism to collect and use capital is becoming even more urgent. It will not only help increase profits, but also provide liquidity and invest in profitable resources, thereby increasing the number of holders. In the next stage, Trava Capital is expected to bring more features to enhance decentralized market-making strategies on Web3, aiming for success in the dynamic DeFi space. These features are hoped to empower stakeholders in Trava Capital to deploy more complex strategies, collectively leveraging the protocol‚Äôs investing models: * Multiple Concentrated Liquidity Positions: Allowing deployment of a custom positions collection, instead of just a single position, enabling the creation of more diverse and complex investment strategies. This gives place for more creativity, freedom and personalization of users in Trava Capital. * Cross-fee Rates: Allowing LPs to allocate their liquidity across multiple fee rates simultaneously within a single liquidity pool. LPs can optimize their exposure to different trading volumes and price ranges within the same pool, based on factors such as trading volume, volatility, and expected profitability. * Inventory Management: Overseeing and deciding if the proportion of a vault‚Äôs assets is exposed to market risk at all times. It‚Äôs optional to add or remove inventory from the market, adjusting based on volume or volatility. This enhances Trava Capital‚Äôs risk management capabilities and strategy effectiveness. * Cross Protocol Rebalancing: Supporting rebalancing of inventory composition across different protocols or DEXs. This capability allows stakeholders to optimize liquidity provision by moving assets between liquidity sources. By minimizing slippage, this feature enhances the efficiency of Trava Capital‚Äôs investing strategies. In the evolving landscape of DeFi, the concentration of its capital market in blockchain networks like Ethereum and Arbitrum presents both challenges and opportunities. Recognizing their growing prominence, as well as the need to adapt and capitalize on emerging trends, Trava Capital is planning to expand its operations to ETH and Arbitrum. With this move, we aim to tap into a broader pool of liquidity, access new investment opportunities, and enhance the efficiency of our capital deployment strategies. This plan is our commitment to keep Trava Capital staying at the forefront in the DeFi space and delivering value to its stakeholders in an ever-evolving market environment. About Trava.Finance Trava Finance is an AI-driven Lending Station.

    "text": "[AMA RECAP] LIQUIDITY AND AI ORIENTATION: Published in 9 min readMar 11, 2024 Share On March 6, 2024, Trava Finance organized an AMA with the CEOs to talk about TRAVA/TOD Listing plan and TravaGPT ‚Äî our ecosystem‚Äôs AI chatbot. Recap Text AMA Liquidity and AI Orientation With the recent increase in questions about the mechanisms of the TRAVA/TOD Listing Liquidity Call program in the community, we believed it necessary to host an AMA session. The Trava Team also took this opportunity to help you understand more about our new product ‚Äî TravaGPT, an AI chatbot created specifically for the Trava ecosystem. Ms. Tilly (Community Mod) was the host of our AMA, with the attendance of Mr. Minh Nguyen and Mr. Thang Nguyen (CEOs and Co-founders of Trava Finance). TRAVA/TOD Listing Liquidity Call In this first part, I think we should get into TRAVA/TOD Listing Liquidity Call right away. Can you give our community an overview of this program, Mr. Minh?: Mr. Minh Nguyen: Ofc. Our program started with the goal of listing the TRAVA/TOD token pair on Pancakeswap. You can read it everywhere, right? Everyone can participate by purchasing and staking their TRAVA or TOD in our Campaign Vaults. When TVL reaches a certain amount, Trava Team will close the Vaults and prepare for listing. Please note that we did not set 6 months staking vaults as normal. When TVLs reach, we will move the fund to the liquidity pool on PCS. But, you know, we have to set the deadline for the vaults on smart contracts. Yes, it‚Äôs 6 months. Someone thinks it is normal 6m vaults. But no. We can close the vaults earlier when reaching TVL. Indeed, the TRAVA vault already closed because it collected a lot and enough TRAVA ‚Äî $250k in TRAVA already‚Ä¶ We would like to call for the TOD staking. The information has been summarized in our infographic here: Here, the LP on PCS liquidity will be locked 6 months, not 6m staking vaults. I hope the explanations can help you understand more about the program",

    "text": "So how is this program doing at the moment, Mr. Thang?: Mr. Thang Nguyen: TRAVA/TOD listing liquidity call is going well actually. Just a few days ago, we closed the TRAVA vault as TVL reached $250k, but this number is still growing as TRAVA price has reached new highs. As for TOD vault, positive progress has also been seen. We‚Äôre still asking for the community‚Äôs opinion on what would be a good number to close it on, and preparing to take the next step in the process. Let‚Äôs see the very positive move on TOD token in the next few months. Mr. Minh Nguyen: We need more your hand for TOD liquidity, community :) Well! What do you think the success of this Listing Liquidity Call will bring to the Trava ecosystem?: Mr. Minh Nguyen: I can say many things: 1 ‚Äî You will have a way to convert your fund from TRAVA to TOD easily. I mean through PCS swap 2 ‚Äî Increase of the utilities for both TOD and TRAVA. 3 ‚Äî As you all know, Trava Finance has gradually shifted towards developing products based on AI advancements ‚Äî being an AI-driven Lending Station. Listing the TRAVA/TOD token pair is one of the activities within that overall goal. The future of TRAVA and TOD is AI, used in our high-tech products and applications. TRAVA/TOD Listing Liquidity Call will create a solid foundation for our upcoming AI integrations. On the other hand, I can say, after listing, there will be many functions released for Trava Capital and ofc for TOD. I think this is a good opportunity to get TOD before the move.

Only users with topic management privileges can see it. * **Trava Administration ** last edited by Administration 18 Aug 2023, 14:04 **1. Idea** As announced recently, we are preparing to launch the Trava Station. Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. **2. Information** Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, **Freight** is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes **Smart Wallet** , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the **main interface** of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don‚Äôt have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA. With Trava Freight, all those laborious, time-consuming and costly steps can be combined into a single transaction. In the current version, the scope of implementation with Freight in particular and Trava Station in general is still quite limited, mainly focusing on Lending Pool, Marketplaces, users' wallets‚Ä¶ The actions include borrowing, returning assets, adding liquidity or withdrawing, executing conversion orders, buying or selling NFTs, tokens or other digital assets. Of course, we will develop the platform further, add more activities and features in the future, so that everyone has a truly seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. **Portfolio** is where you can keep track of your position and all your assets in Smart Wallet in Trava Station. **Tramlines** and **Junction** are complementary features to Freight, in which Tramlines provide a list of pre-made sequences with arranged actions for you to import. Meanwhile, Junction consists of sequences that are not executed when you create, but are made active by a system bot only when a condition is reached. * For example, you can create a set of actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price reaches $1000 ‚Äî so when this threshold appears, our system bot will execute the pre-arranged actions. **3. Ask** After reading the above information, you may have understood a little more about Trava Station and our vision, right? We treasure all your opinions, because you are who Trava Station was built to serve. So let us know what you think about this upcoming product, suggesting for further development!! And look forward to the launch of Trava Station on **August 24, 2023**. 1 Reply Last reply 24 Aug 2023, 20:27 * @Administration last edited by @administration This looks awesome.

Idea At the bear market, Trava Team focuses on building more features and products to expand the Trava Ecosystem. For example, to better manage Trava Lending Pool, Trava Finance has launched Governance. However, we'd also love to hear more from Trava Knights, and see the different perspectives on the flow of ideas. So with the ultimate goal of building a robust and diverse Lending protocol, we decided to start this Idea Contest. 2. Discussion Raise your idea for developing products in Trava Finance's ecosystem: Trava Lending Pool Trava Capital Trava Knight NFT Remember that Trava is Decentralized, so your ideas do not have to be limited to the above, or any technology, community or country. We'll listen to everyone's opinions, sifting through ideas from varying degrees of plausibility. Ultimately, the development of these services/products is entirely decided by Trava Knights, through a process of discussion and voting. With each idea, the Trava Team will be in charge of evaluation and debate to build the best finalists. The contributions from the Trava community will be a huge strength for the Trava Finance ecosystem. 3. Execution All you have to do is create a Topic with IdeaContest in the title, state your idea and submit it to Trava Forum in any categories of the three: Trava Lending Pool, Knight NFT and Trava Capital. We will be accepting your ideas until 10 A.M. UTC on May 5, 2023. After that, a voting snapshot will be opened, then the best ideas selected for implementation will be rewarded with 500,000 TRAVA.

I think this is due to the attractiveness of farming. Perhaps V2 knights should be able to farm using heuristic farming? If creating one V2 helmet requires two V1 helmets, then a V2 knight should represent a larger amount of trava tokens as a basis for farming. I think this could help boost the market for V2 knights. üôÇ *",

Idea At the bear market, Trava Team focuses on building more features and products to expand the Trava Ecosystem. For example, to better manage Trava Lending Pool, Trava Finance has launched Governance. However, we'd also love to hear more from Trava Knights, and see the different perspectives on the flow of ideas. So with the ultimate goal of building a robust and diverse Lending protocol, we decided to start this Idea Contest. 2. Discussion Raise your idea for developing products in Trava Finance's ecosystem: Trava Lending Pool Trava Capital Trava Knight NFT Remember that Trava is Decentralized, so your ideas do not have to be limited to the above, or any technology, community or country. We'll listen to everyone's opinions, sifting through ideas from varying degrees of plausibility. Ultimately, the development of these services/products is entirely decided by Trava Knights, through a process of discussion and voting. With each idea, the Trava Team will be in charge of evaluation and debate to build the best finalists. The contributions from the Trava community will be a huge strength for the Trava Finance ecosystem. 3. Execution All you have to do is create a Topic with IdeaContest in the title, state your idea and submit it to Trava Forum in any categories of the three: Trava Lending Pool, Knight NFT and Trava Capital. We will be accepting your ideas until 10 A.M. UTC on May 5, 2023. After that, a voting snapshot will be opened, then the best ideas selected for implementation will be rewarded with 500,000 TRAVA. Raise your idea now to build up our ecosystem together! *",

I think this is due to the attractiveness of farming. Perhaps V2 knights should be able to farm using heuristic farming? If creating one V2 helmet requires two V1 helmets, then a V2 knight should represent a larger amount of trava tokens as a basis for farming. I think this could help boost the market for V2 knights. üôÇ *",

We need to dump Fantom and move on asap. Time is money and our token price is low. We should pounce on either Optimism or Base. Base is likely going to be huge. But either choice is a great move. Time to move on. I feel we need Bricher to be updated asap on BNB as well.

We need to dump Fantom and move on asap. Time is money and our token price is low. We should pounce on either Optimism or Base. Base is likely going to be huge. But either choice is a great move. Time to move on. I feel we need Bricher to be updated asap on BNB as well. Any new chain choice should be the one easiest for your developers to add Bricher to be used in that network as well instead of just BNB only.

We should get away from it completely and just stick with USDC and Tether for now. BNB: Due to global regulators attacking CZ which is BNB really, we should be cautious and begin expanding to more chains quickly in case anything happens to BNB. I feel if BNB goes down Trava is done for since most of its utility is on that chain. That's a huge risk that the team cannot control that has nothing to do with Trava and its investors so we should protect accordingly and diversify. @jefe811 said in IdeaContest--Lending Pool-Trava Knight-Trava Capital: Adding more new chains. Having BNB, ETH, and FTM is great. But, more are needed. Maybe we could put out voting for this issue and which ones to choose. The other issue is most Trava features are just for the BNB chain. ETH and FTM chain users should have all the same feature use as BNB. If they did I feel the TVL on these chains would increase drastically. Agree, there will be pulsechain, fork eth 2.0 much cheaper and faster than eth or polygon matic, and cosmos are cheap aswell and fast, matic is strong project @jefe811 said in IdeaContest--Lending Pool-Trava Knight-Trava Capital: Trava Capital: Trava capital needs a lot of help. It is impossible to understand what money in reserves is actually there. Also what is the actual token circulation count? Coinmarketcap and Coingecko need updates on the token since the price is not tracked anymore. No way for investors to know what the value per token is based off of reserve assets. There should be a visually easy view of token reserves or investments along with their daily market price then divided amongst the circulation we now all know the value per token. I feel a team is needed just for this protocol and if there is one and that's all they do, then we need more folks. We also need more communication. My biggest fear for Trava capital it seems to be a blatant or obvious security or stock share the way it is designed now. Being from the USA I may not be allowed to trade these in the future unfortunately. Thats point, Team should not, skip this kinda situation, its looks bad on view, when tokens is just non tracked. Also we dont know how money left for investing, etc We need more partnership with project, some ama with other group/teams for marketing trava capital and trava token. @jefe811 said in IdeaContest--Lending Pool-Trava Knight-Trava Capital: Trava should use some of the transaction fees earned to complete monthly or quarterly burn of the original amount of minted Trava. This should stay in place permanently. This will only make the price of Trava more valuable. Thats not bad idea, for price token, but honestly i prefer keep money for marketing with others project/people ama's partnerships etc, in social media is silent, i had proposal fore crew 3 but aswell is silent about this idea, we dont have much retweets/likes on tt page compare for followers, dunno why. Also we waiting still for ama with team for more information and team vision about future Tod and Trava. *",

Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. **2. Information** Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, **Freight** is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes **Smart Wallet** , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the **main interface** of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don‚Äôt have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA. With Trava Freight, all those laborious, time-consuming and costly steps can be combined into a single transaction. In the current version, the scope of implementation with Freight in particular and Trava Station in general is still quite limited, mainly focusing on Lending Pool, Marketplaces, users' wallets‚Ä¶ The actions include borrowing, returning assets, adding liquidity or withdrawing, executing conversion orders, buying or selling NFTs, tokens or other digital assets. Of course, we will develop the platform further, add more activities and features in the future, so that everyone has a truly seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. **Portfolio** is where you can keep track of your position and all your assets in Smart Wallet in Trava Station. **Tramlines** and **Junction** are complementary features to Freight, in which Tramlines provide a list of pre-made sequences with arranged actions for you to import. Meanwhile, Junction consists of sequences that are not executed when you create, but are made active by a system bot only when a condition is reached. * For example, you can create a set of actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price reaches $1000 ‚Äî so when this threshold appears, our system bot will execute the pre-arranged actions. **3. Ask** After reading the above information, you may have understood a little more about Trava Station and our vision, right? We treasure all your opinions, because you are who Trava Station was built to serve. So let us know what you think about this upcoming product, suggesting for further development!! And look forward to the launch of Trava Station on **August 24, 2023**. ]]>https://gov.trava.finance/topic/57/call-for-suggestions-to-improve-trava-station-to-best-suits-your-demandsRSS for NodeFri, 07 Feb 2025 02:49:58 GMTFri, 11 Aug 2023 14:06:00 GMT60Interesting ]]>https://gov.trava.finance/post/262https://gov.trava.finance/post/262Fri, 24 Nov 2023 06:00:29 GMT@administration This looks awesome.

Home: Administration Following 0 Followers 3 Topics 12 Posts 13 Best 8 Groups 1 Trava Administration Joined 18 Apr 2022, 17:39 Last Online 29 Aug 2024, 16:02 About me: Trava Adminstration Reputation 39 Profile views 80 Posts Followers Following Website Administration Unfollow Follow Best posts made by Administration * Trava Governance Explanation posted in Governance With Trava Governance, we provide our users with decision-making power. By doing so, we gather the crowd‚Äôs wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community‚Äôs benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users ‚Äî our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we‚Äôll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They‚Äôll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope ‚Äî Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

Our community is doing great, but we need to be greater than ever. Welcome to TRAVA Forum! Your contribution is the power of the whole community. Trava Administration 18 Apr 2022, 22:41 * IDEA CONTEST FOR THE GROWTH OF TRAVA FINANCE‚ÄôS ECOSYSTEM posted in Announcements 1. Idea At the bear market, Trava Team focuses on building more features and products to expand the Trava Ecosystem. For example, to better manage Trava Lending Pool, Trava Finance has launched Governance. However, we'd also love to hear more from Trava Knights, and see the different perspectives on the flow of ideas. So with the ultimate goal of building a robust and diverse Lending protocol, we decided to start this Idea Contest. 2. Discussion Raise your idea for developing products in Trava Finance's ecosystem: * Trava Lending Pool * Trava Capital * Trava Knight NFT Remember that Trava is Decentralized, so your ideas do not have to be limited to the above, or any technology, community or country. We'll listen to everyone's opinions, sifting through ideas from varying degrees of plausibility. Ultimately, the development of these services/products is entirely decided by Trava Knights, through a process of discussion and voting. With each idea, the Trava Team will be in charge of evaluation and debate to build the best finalists. The contributions from the Trava community will be a huge strength for the Trava Finance ecosystem. 3.

Raise your idea now to build up our ecosystem together! Trava Administration 26 Apr 2023, 10:05 * Welcome to Trava‚Äôs forum! posted in For Beginners Welcome to Trava Knights Forum! TRAVA is the world‚Äôs first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. This forum is used for Trava community to contribute to the decision-making process of the Trava protocol by proposing and discussing appropriate improvements & changes.

There are those who gave not only one but dozens of different opinions, on many aspects and products of Trava Finance. From there, we have selected 10 ideas to proceed further: 1. Open a contest for community members to create their own knights. 2. Restructure the main page of Trava, removing the mountains with links to make it seem more user-friendly and easier to understand Trava's focus. 3. Expand to other chains and add new ones, since BNB is in a potentially risky position. 4. Add more DeFi protocols to BRicher, regularly updating good protocols and removing unsafe ones. 5. Simplify the parameters in Lending Pools and add more tokens. Add a type of notification so people would know when liquidations are close. 6. Increase the utility of TRAVA tokens by adding continuous token burn feature, periodically burning minted TRAVA. Allow them to be exchanged on all chains in Trava Lending. 7. Reopen BNB/Trava safety passbook. 8. Launch Knights leasing feature. 9. Do Idea Contest more periodically. 10. Start marketing on Crew3. Motivation: Each of the ideas has been thoroughly researched by us, evaluated for their potential and feasibility. Don't be sad if your ideas are not here, they might just be slightly deviating from Trava Finance's development orientation, or not yet capable of being put into practice. This discussion is open in order to be able to involve the whole community in contributing to the development of Trava Finance. It‚Äôs expected to be a stepping stone before starting the voting snapshot, for everyone to dive deeper into these ideas and voice their own comments. From there, it is also possible for you to pick the best choices for the development of Trava, choosing a worthy winner (or winners). The founders and POs of Trava Finance will also check out this discussion, so don't be afraid to dig into each issue and ask the hard questions. Trava Administration 5 May 2023, 22:00 * Should TravaGPT Support the Polish Language? posted in Others TravaGPT has recently attracted many users from Poland, and we also received some proposals to add the Polish language. Therefore, we‚Äôd like to raise opinions from you guys on: Should TravaGPT support the Polish language? What do you think about this idea? Let‚Äôs cast your vote & share your thoughts now! Trava Administration 3 Jul 2024, 21:00 * Call for suggestions to improve Trava Station to best suits your demands. posted in Lending 1. Idea As announced recently, we are preparing to launch the Trava Station. Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. 2. Information Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, Freight is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes Smart Wallet , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the main interface of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don‚Äôt have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA. With Trava Freight, all those laborious, time-consuming and costly steps can be combined into a single transaction. In the current version, the scope of implementation with Freight in particular and Trava Station in general is still quite limited, mainly focusing on Lending Pool, Marketplaces, users' wallets‚Ä¶ The actions include borrowing, returning assets, adding liquidity or withdrawing, executing conversion orders, buying or selling NFTs, tokens or other digital assets. Of course, we will develop the platform further, add more activities and features in the future, so that everyone has a truly seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. Portfolio is where you can keep track of your position and all your assets in Smart Wallet in Trava Station. Tramlines and Junction are complementary features to Freight, in which Tramlines provide a list of pre-made sequences with arranged actions for you to import. Meanwhile, Junction consists of sequences that are not executed when you create, but are made active by a system bot only when a condition is reached. * For example, you can create a set of actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price reaches $1000 ‚Äî so when this threshold appears, our system bot will execute the pre-arranged actions. 3. Ask After reading the above information, you may have understood a little more about Trava Station and our vision, right? We treasure all your opinions, because you are who Trava Station was built to serve. So let us know what you think about this upcoming product, suggesting for further development!! And look forward to the launch of Trava Station on August 24, 2023 . Trava Administration 11 Aug 2023, 21:06 * Idea Contest for Trava Station posted in Lending 1.

Correspondingly, when technology reaches another high and the market is in a bullish phase with many opportunities awaiting, it‚Äôs time for renovation and innovation. Therefore, our team has discussed carefully and had the first thoughts about the updates we can make with Trava Capital. We intend to separate it from Trava Finance into its own being ‚Äî an AI platform that enables running liquidity provision strategies on blockchains. But no matter which direction we go, our ultimate goal is still to benefit users and the entire Trava ecosystem. Our community is always the center. 2. Information: Trava Capital is an important pillar of our ecosystem, which currently provides users with two main investment models ‚Äî Treasury and Crowdfunding. It has been and is still bringing benefits to the community, however, our team foresees its even brighter future. Our goal is to build a trustless market-making infrastructure & strategies on DEX V3, as well as Lending pool on multi-chains, with the integration of AI technology. From there, Liquidity providers can utilize our features to have their liquidity managed in an automated, capital-efficient, non-custodial, and transparent manner. We hope to democratize market-making, enabling DEXs and Lending to become the primary trading venue for all assets, even beyond crypto.",

As mentioned in our recent article and AMA, TOD will play a very important role in the future of Trava Capital. Our new model is expected to provide more features to enhance decentralized market-making strategies on Web3, aiming for success in the dynamic DeFi space. Therefore, getting a good TVL number with TOD Vault this time and then listing the TRAVA/TOD token pair will be a perfect launching pad for Trava Capital's next steps. We want to hear more on the community's opinions Raise your voice here Ô∏è Trava Administration 26 Mar 2024, 21:00 * Actions to take facing the Fantom situation posted in Lending 1. Idea Recently, Fantom ‚Äì one of the networks where Trava Finance deployed its lending system ‚Äì encountered serious problems. In such a situation, every step must be carefully calculated to ensure the safety of our ecosystem, particularly the users. And as a DeFi platform, Trava Team always wants to listen and incorporate community opinions into each of our decisions. 2. Approach Fantom is a high-speed blockchain platform, one of the largest in the cryptocurrency world with a wide range of influence, making its demise even more damaging. In just the first half of 2023, it has suffered countless blows to its core, leading to a terrible decline of its native token FTM. You can get more detailed information in this analysis of the situation on our blog HERE. In this situation, although we have urgently suspended our lending pool on Fantom, Trava Finance still needs to consider the next steps to protect the community. So, after discussion, Trava Team has come up with some ideas as follows: * Keep patience and give the Fantom situation time to resolve itself ‚Äî waiting for the recovery of the ecosystem of DeFi products on Fantom. Besides the bad news, there are obviously some additional things to consider. For example, the Fantom Foundation has announced that it is working on a new cross-chain bridge that will be more secure than Multichain. Its community is still also active with a number of projects being developed, suggesting that some investors are still optimistic about its future. * Develop new features corresponding to Fantom's situation. To face the ongoing problems, Trava Finance has also thought about possibly developing technologies to overcome the challenge. It can lay the foundation for us to deal with similar situations in the future. However, this option faces a huge weakness which is the lack of immediacy, which could mean missing out on the golden time for future development. * Find another ecosystem rather than Fantom, moving there and creating a more resilient community. Although Fantom is strong, it is not the only one in the crypto world. There is no shortage of similar communities, perhaps even larger, to replace Fantom. Lately, there have also been many small but full of potential groups appearing on the market, promising a bright future. We have various options to target and make contact with such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, ‚Ä¶ 3. Discussion So the question here is how do you think we should choose? If you have another opinion believed to be more reasonable, don't hesitate to speak out. We will carefully review everything to reach a final best decision.

Idea** As announced recently, we are preparing to launch the Trava Station. Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. **2. Information** Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, **Freight** is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes **Smart Wallet** , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the **main interface** of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don‚Äôt have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA. With Trava Freight, all those laborious, time-consuming and costly steps can be combined into a single transaction. In the current version, the scope of implementation with Freight in particular and Trava Station in general is still quite limited, mainly focusing on Lending Pool, Marketplaces, users' wallets‚Ä¶ The actions include borrowing, returning assets, adding liquidity or withdrawing, executing conversion orders, buying or selling NFTs, tokens or other digital assets. Of course, we will develop the platform further, add more activities and features in the future, so that everyone has a truly seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. **Portfolio** is where you can keep track of your position and all your assets in Smart Wallet in Trava Station. **Tramlines** and **Junction** are complementary features to Freight, in which Tramlines provide a list of pre-made sequences with arranged actions for you to import. Meanwhile, Junction consists of sequences that are not executed when you create, but are made active by a system bot only when a condition is reached. * For example, you can create a set of actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price reaches $1000 ‚Äî so when this threshold appears, our system bot will execute the pre-arranged actions. **3. Ask** After reading the above information, you may have understood a little more about Trava Station and our vision, right? We treasure all your opinions, because you are who Trava Station was built to serve. So let us know what you think about this upcoming product, suggesting for further development!!

By doing so, we gather the crowd‚Äôs wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community‚Äôs benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users ‚Äî our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we‚Äôll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They‚Äôll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope ‚Äî Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

Our community is doing great, but we need to be greater than ever. Welcome to TRAVA Forum! Your contribution is the power of the whole community. Trava Administration 18 Apr 2022, 22:41 * IDEA CONTEST FOR THE GROWTH OF TRAVA FINANCE‚ÄôS ECOSYSTEM posted in Announcements 1. Idea At the bear market, Trava Team focuses on building more features and products to expand the Trava Ecosystem. For example, to better manage Trava Lending Pool, Trava Finance has launched Governance. However, we'd also love to hear more from Trava Knights, and see the different perspectives on the flow of ideas. So with the ultimate goal of building a robust and diverse Lending protocol, we decided to start this Idea Contest. 2. Discussion Raise your idea for developing products in Trava Finance's ecosystem: * Trava Lending Pool * Trava Capital * Trava Knight NFT Remember that Trava is Decentralized, so your ideas do not have to be limited to the above, or any technology, community or country. We'll listen to everyone's opinions, sifting through ideas from varying degrees of plausibility. Ultimately, the development of these services/products is entirely decided by Trava Knights, through a process of discussion and voting. With each idea, the Trava Team will be in charge of evaluation and debate to build the best finalists. The contributions from the Trava community will be a huge strength for the Trava Finance ecosystem. 3. Execution All you have to do is create a Topic with IdeaContest in the title, state your idea and submit it to Trava Forum in any categories of the three: Trava Lending Pool, Knight NFT and Trava Capital. We will be accepting your ideas until 10 A.M. UTC on May 5, 2023. After that, a voting snapshot will be opened, then the best ideas selected for implementation will be rewarded with 500,000 TRAVA. Raise your idea now to build up our ecosystem together! Trava Administration 26 Apr 2023, 10:05 * Welcome to Trava‚Äôs forum! posted in For Beginners Welcome to Trava Knights Forum! TRAVA is the world‚Äôs first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending.

There are those who gave not only one but dozens of different opinions, on many aspects and products of Trava Finance. From there, we have selected 10 ideas to proceed further: 1. Open a contest for community members to create their own knights. 2. Restructure the main page of Trava, removing the mountains with links to make it seem more user-friendly and easier to understand Trava's focus. 3. Expand to other chains and add new ones, since BNB is in a potentially risky position. 4. Add more DeFi protocols to BRicher, regularly updating good protocols and removing unsafe ones. 5. Simplify the parameters in Lending Pools and add more tokens. Add a type of notification so people would know when liquidations are close. 6. Increase the utility of TRAVA tokens by adding continuous token burn feature, periodically burning minted TRAVA. Allow them to be exchanged on all chains in Trava Lending. 7. Reopen BNB/Trava safety passbook. 8. Launch Knights leasing feature. 9. Do Idea Contest more periodically. 10. Start marketing on Crew3. Motivation: Each of the ideas has been thoroughly researched by us, evaluated for their potential and feasibility. Don't be sad if your ideas are not here, they might just be slightly deviating from Trava Finance's development orientation, or not yet capable of being put into practice. This discussion is open in order to be able to involve the whole community in contributing to the development of Trava Finance. It‚Äôs expected to be a stepping stone before starting the voting snapshot, for everyone to dive deeper into these ideas and voice their own comments. From there, it is also possible for you to pick the best choices for the development of Trava, choosing a worthy winner (or winners). The founders and POs of Trava Finance will also check out this discussion, so don't be afraid to dig into each issue and ask the hard questions.

Idea As announced recently, we are preparing to launch the Trava Station. Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. 2. Information Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, Freight is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes Smart Wallet , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the main interface of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don‚Äôt have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA. With Trava Freight, all those laborious, time-consuming and costly steps can be combined into a single transaction. In the current version, the scope of implementation with Freight in particular and Trava Station in general is still quite limited, mainly focusing on Lending Pool, Marketplaces, users' wallets‚Ä¶ The actions include borrowing, returning assets, adding liquidity or withdrawing, executing conversion orders, buying or selling NFTs, tokens or other digital assets. Of course, we will develop the platform further, add more activities and features in the future, so that everyone has a truly seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. Portfolio is where you can keep track of your position and all your assets in Smart Wallet in Trava Station. Tramlines and Junction are complementary features to Freight, in which Tramlines provide a list of pre-made sequences with arranged actions for you to import. Meanwhile, Junction consists of sequences that are not executed when you create, but are made active by a system bot only when a condition is reached. * For example, you can create a set of actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price reaches $1000 ‚Äî so when this threshold appears, our system bot will execute the pre-arranged actions. 3. Ask After reading the above information, you may have understood a little more about Trava Station and our vision, right?

Correspondingly, when technology reaches another high and the market is in a bullish phase with many opportunities awaiting, it‚Äôs time for renovation and innovation. Therefore, our team has discussed carefully and had the first thoughts about the updates we can make with Trava Capital. We intend to separate it from Trava Finance into its own being ‚Äî an AI platform that enables running liquidity provision strategies on blockchains. But no matter which direction we go, our ultimate goal is still to benefit users and the entire Trava ecosystem. Our community is always the center. 2. Information: Trava Capital is an important pillar of our ecosystem, which currently provides users with two main investment models ‚Äî Treasury and Crowdfunding. It has been and is still bringing benefits to the community, however, our team foresees its even brighter future. Our goal is to build a trustless market-making infrastructure & strategies on DEX V3, as well as Lending pool on multi-chains, with the integration of AI technology. From there, Liquidity providers can utilize our features to have their liquidity managed in an automated, capital-efficient, non-custodial, and transparent manner. We hope to democratize market-making, enabling DEXs and Lending to become the primary trading venue for all assets, even beyond crypto.",

As mentioned in our recent article and AMA, TOD will play a very important role in the future of Trava Capital. Our new model is expected to provide more features to enhance decentralized market-making strategies on Web3, aiming for success in the dynamic DeFi space. Therefore, getting a good TVL number with TOD Vault this time and then listing the TRAVA/TOD token pair will be a perfect launching pad for Trava Capital's next steps. We want to hear more on the community's opinions Raise your voice here Ô∏è Trava Administration 26 Mar 2024, 21:00 * Actions to take facing the Fantom situation posted in Lending 1. Idea Recently, Fantom ‚Äì one of the networks where Trava Finance deployed its lending system ‚Äì encountered serious problems. In such a situation, every step must be carefully calculated to ensure the safety of our ecosystem, particularly the users. And as a DeFi platform, Trava Team always wants to listen and incorporate community opinions into each of our decisions. 2. Approach Fantom is a high-speed blockchain platform, one of the largest in the cryptocurrency world with a wide range of influence, making its demise even more damaging. In just the first half of 2023, it has suffered countless blows to its core, leading to a terrible decline of its native token FTM. You can get more detailed information in this analysis of the situation on our blog HERE. In this situation, although we have urgently suspended our lending pool on Fantom, Trava Finance still needs to consider the next steps to protect the community. So, after discussion, Trava Team has come up with some ideas as follows: * Keep patience and give the Fantom situation time to resolve itself ‚Äî waiting for the recovery of the ecosystem of DeFi products on Fantom. Besides the bad news, there are obviously some additional things to consider. For example, the Fantom Foundation has announced that it is working on a new cross-chain bridge that will be more secure than Multichain. Its community is still also active with a number of projects being developed, suggesting that some investors are still optimistic about its future. * Develop new features corresponding to Fantom's situation. To face the ongoing problems, Trava Finance has also thought about possibly developing technologies to overcome the challenge. It can lay the foundation for us to deal with similar situations in the future. However, this option faces a huge weakness which is the lack of immediacy, which could mean missing out on the golden time for future development. * Find another ecosystem rather than Fantom, moving there and creating a more resilient community. Although Fantom is strong, it is not the only one in the crypto world. There is no shortage of similar communities, perhaps even larger, to replace Fantom. Lately, there have also been many small but full of potential groups appearing on the market, promising a bright future. We have various options to target and make contact with such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, ‚Ä¶ 3. Discussion So the question here is how do you think we should choose? If you have another opinion believed to be more reasonable, don't hesitate to speak out. We will carefully review everything to reach a final best decision. Raise your thoughts now to build up our ecosystem together! Trava Administration 14 Sept 2023, 21:00 * Idea Contest for Trava Station posted in Lending 1.

Increase the utility of TRAVA tokens by adding continuous token burn feature, periodically burning minted TRAVA. Allow them to be exchanged on all chains in Trava Lending. 7. Reopen BNB/Trava safety passbook. 8. Launch Knights leasing feature. 9. Do Idea Contest more periodically. 10. Start marketing on Crew3. Motivation: Each of the ideas has been thoroughly researched by us, evaluated for their potential and feasibility. Don't be sad if your ideas are not here, they might just be slightly deviating from Trava Finance's development orientation, or not yet capable of being put into practice. This discussion is open in order to be able to involve the whole community in contributing to the development of Trava Finance. It‚Äôs expected to be a stepping stone before starting the voting snapshot, for everyone to dive deeper into these ideas and voice their own comments. From there, it is also possible for you to pick the best choices for the development of Trava, choosing a worthy winner (or winners). The founders and POs of Trava Finance will also check out this discussion, so don't be afraid to dig into each issue and ask the hard questions. Trava Administration 5 May 2023, 22:00 * IDEA CONTEST FOR THE GROWTH OF TRAVA FINANCE‚ÄôS ECOSYSTEM posted in Announcements 1. Idea At the bear market, Trava Team focuses on building more features and products to expand the Trava Ecosystem. For example, to better manage Trava Lending Pool, Trava Finance has launched Governance. However, we'd also love to hear more from Trava Knights, and see the different perspectives on the flow of ideas. So with the ultimate goal of building a robust and diverse Lending protocol, we decided to start this Idea Contest. 2. Discussion Raise your idea for developing products in Trava Finance's ecosystem: * Trava Lending Pool * Trava Capital * Trava Knight NFT Remember that Trava is Decentralized, so your ideas do not have to be limited to the above, or any technology, community or country. We'll listen to everyone's opinions, sifting through ideas from varying degrees of plausibility. Ultimately, the development of these services/products is entirely decided by Trava Knights, through a process of discussion and voting. With each idea, the Trava Team will be in charge of evaluation and debate to build the best finalists. The contributions from the Trava community will be a huge strength for the Trava Finance ecosystem. 3. Execution All you have to do is create a Topic with IdeaContest in the title, state your idea and submit it to Trava Forum in any categories of the three: Trava Lending Pool, Knight NFT and Trava Capital. We will be accepting your ideas until 10 A.M. UTC on May 5, 2023. After that, a voting snapshot will be opened, then the best ideas selected for implementation will be rewarded with 500,000 TRAVA. Raise your idea now to build up our ecosystem together! Trava Administration 26 Apr 2023, 10:05 √ó Looks like your connection to Trava Forum was lost, please wait while we try to reconnect.",

Only users with topic management privileges can see it. * **Trava Administration ** last edited by Administration 18 Aug 2023, 14:04 **1. Idea** As announced recently, we are preparing to launch the Trava Station. Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. **2. Information** Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, **Freight** is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes **Smart Wallet** , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the **main interface** of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don‚Äôt have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA. With Trava Freight, all those laborious, time-consuming and costly steps can be combined into a single transaction. In the current version, the scope of implementation with Freight in particular and Trava Station in general is still quite limited, mainly focusing on Lending Pool, Marketplaces, users' wallets‚Ä¶ The actions include borrowing, returning assets, adding liquidity or withdrawing, executing conversion orders, buying or selling NFTs, tokens or other digital assets. Of course, we will develop the platform further, add more activities and features in the future, so that everyone has a truly seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. **Portfolio** is where you can keep track of your position and all your assets in Smart Wallet in Trava Station. **Tramlines** and **Junction** are complementary features to Freight, in which Tramlines provide a list of pre-made sequences with arranged actions for you to import. Meanwhile, Junction consists of sequences that are not executed when you create, but are made active by a system bot only when a condition is reached. * For example, you can create a set of actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price reaches $1000 ‚Äî so when this threshold appears, our system bot will execute the pre-arranged actions. **3. Ask** After reading the above information, you may have understood a little more about Trava Station and our vision, right? We treasure all your opinions, because you are who Trava Station was built to serve. So let us know what you think about this upcoming product, suggesting for further development!! And look forward to the launch of Trava Station on **August 24, 2023**. 1 Reply Last reply 24 Aug 2023, 20:27 * @Administration last edited by @administration This looks awesome.

    "text": "MINI AMA RECAP ‚Äî TRAVA x TCV: EXPLORE TCV‚ÄôS EARLY SEED ROUND: Published in 6 min readSep 17, 2024 Share On September 13th, 2024, Trava Finance and TCV hosted a Mini AMA to help explore all the opportunities and benefits in TCV‚Äôs Early Seed Round. This event was organized on the Trava Telegram channel, stirring great excitement of the community. With the honored presence of Ms. Hailey, Tech Lead of TCV, this small AMA meeting provided crucial information about TCV‚Äôs Early Seed Round and addressed the audience‚Äôs questions. The event covered 3 main sections: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview of TCV‚Äôs present product and tokenomics. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Mechanism and instructions for purchasing TCV. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Community questions. Let‚Äôs dive into the discussions! Overview of TCV‚Äôs present product and tokenomics First Question: TCV has undergone a long development process. Could you update the present products of TCV platform to our community, please? TCV is developing as an AI platform enabling liquidity strategies provision for DeFi on DEX V3 & Lending pool on multi-chains. At present, the platform provides 5 pools on Arbitrum 1 , corresponding to those of Uniswap . üìå More importantly, only when providing liquidity on TCV vaults, users can maximize their liquidity with our optimized APR and manage their liquidity in an automated, capital-efficient, non-custodial, and transparent manner. üåü Now, here are the pools that have the best APR optimized on TCV platform üëâ You can take a closer look at these pools and join them: Second Question: Your project already has a clear tokenomics for your native token ‚Äî $TCV, right? So what is the potential it holds for $TCV? Unlike other nonsense tokens, $TCV is listed to serve the long-term journey of TCV products. Our current plan for this token focuses on two main objectives: Governance and Fee Payments within the Protocol. üìç The total supply of $TCV is capped at 168 million tokens, with an initial market cap of $200,000 . The tokens will be distributed across seven categories shown in the tokenomics below. üî• Especially, the Early Seed Round of $TCV, part of the Seed Sale, represents just 0.1% of the total supply, offering an exclusive opportunity to purchase $TCV at an optimal price.‚Äù üìç Additionally, the $TOD treasury will be recognized as part of the tokens sold in the Private Sale round for $TCV, ensuring that the rights of $TOD holders are fully protected. Mechanism and instructions for purchasing TCV Third Question: TCV‚Äôs Early Seed Round for Trava Finance was kicked off yesterday! What is the objective of this event? Well, our Early Seed Round is a seed sale program, selling $TCV early at good prices for limited communities or individuals. This program starts first with Trava members, offering the best price of $TCV ever ( ~60% lower than the listing pric e) üöÄ Initiating with the Trava community, this event will pave the way for the listing of $TCV üöÄ Fourth question: Can you explain to Trava members how to join this early seed sale, please? In this Early Seed Round, anyone who joins the Trava community or uses Trava products can buy $TCV at ‚ö° ONLY $0.14 ‚ö° Meanwhile, the listing price is $0.34 . üëâ You can make your purchase easily right on the TCV Platform: ‚ùó Note: You need to connect your wallet, choose Arbitrum Network, and buy $TCV with $USDT The early $TCV bought will be recorded in our Smart Contract, you can claim your tokens when $TCV is officially listed. The amount of $TCV available to be claimed will be based on the rate of Token Generate Event (TGE), which is set at 10% . Then within 3 months of the vesting term, you can claim all of the $TCV tokens that you have bought in this early seed round. Answers community questions In this AMA, Ms. Haily also revealed important information about this seed sale and $TCV listing through the answers to the community‚Äôs questions.",

    "text": "X Questions: First Question ‚Äî : Could you elaborate on the strategic reasons behind TCV‚Äôs decision to partner with Trava for this Early Seed Round? How does this partnership align with TCV‚Äôs goals and vision for its native token, $TCV? Since the launch of TCV, we‚Äôve maintained a strong connection with the Trava community, and we want to offer the first opportunities to Trava enthusiasts. In this Early Seed Round, anyone involved in the Trava community or using Trava products will have the chance to purchase $TCV at the best possible price. Notably, $TCV is already showing significant growth potential. We believe that the Early Seed Round for the Trava community will pave the way for a successful listing of $TCV. Second Question ‚Äî : I have been participating in Trava for a long time. So how do I qualify to buy? In this Early Seed Round, anyone who joins the Trava community or uses Trava products can buy $TCV at the best price ever: ‚ö°Ô∏è $0.14 ‚ö°Ô∏è Meanwhile, the listing price is $0.34 üöÄ Third Question ‚Äî : How does TCV plan to manage the transition from the Early Seed Round to the public listing of $TCV? What are the key milestones and timelines involved in this transition process? After this early sale, we definitely keep investing efforts and finance sources in TCV products and brand awareness to ensure the growth of the project. We believe this is the core value of the $TCV token, ensuring the safety of buyers who put their trust in us. That being said, we target to achieve a great number of users and expand our partnership to wider Web3 communities, before listing $TCV. And this process is accelerating, so stay tuned! Especially, this Early Seed Sale has sold almost half of $TCV volume within just 1 day! This is a good sign for the potential of $TCV token.",

This event was organized on the Trava Telegram channel, stirring great excitement of the community. With the honored presence of Ms. Hailey, Tech Lead of TCV, this small AMA meeting provided crucial information about TCV‚Äôs Early Seed Round and addressed the audience‚Äôs questions. The event covered 3 main sections: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview of TCV‚Äôs present product and tokenomics. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Mechanism and instructions for purchasing TCV. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Community questions. Let‚Äôs dive into the discussions! Overview of TCV‚Äôs present product and tokenomics First Question: TCV has undergone a long development process. Could you update the present products of TCV platform to our community, please? TCV is developing as an AI platform enabling liquidity strategies provision for DeFi on DEX V3 & Lending pool on multi-chains. At present, the platform provides 5 pools on Arbitrum 1 , corresponding to those of Uniswap . üìå More importantly, only when providing liquidity on TCV vaults, users can maximize their liquidity with our optimized APR and manage their liquidity in an automated, capital-efficient, non-custodial, and transparent manner. üåü Now, here are the pools that have the best APR optimized on TCV platform üëâ You can take a closer look at these pools and join them: Second Question: Your project already has a clear tokenomics for your native token ‚Äî $TCV, right? So what is the potential it holds for $TCV? Unlike other nonsense tokens, $TCV is listed to serve the long-term journey of TCV products. Our current plan for this token focuses on two main objectives: Governance and Fee Payments within the Protocol. üìç The total supply of $TCV is capped at 168 million tokens, with an initial market cap of $200,000 . The tokens will be distributed across seven categories shown in the tokenomics below. üî• Especially, the Early Seed Round of $TCV, part of the Seed Sale, represents just 0.1% of the total supply, offering an exclusive opportunity to purchase $TCV at an optimal price.‚Äù üìç Additionally, the $TOD treasury will be recognized as part of the tokens sold in the Private Sale round for $TCV, ensuring that the rights of $TOD holders are fully protected. Mechanism and instructions for purchasing TCV Third Question: TCV‚Äôs Early Seed Round for Trava Finance was kicked off yesterday! What is the objective of this event? Well, our Early Seed Round is a seed sale program, selling $TCV early at good prices for limited communities or individuals. This program starts first with Trava members, offering the best price of $TCV ever ( ~60% lower than the listing pric e) üöÄ Initiating with the Trava community, this event will pave the way for the listing of $TCV üöÄ Fourth question: Can you explain to Trava members how to join this early seed sale, please? In this Early Seed Round, anyone who joins the Trava community or uses Trava products can buy $TCV at ‚ö° ONLY $0.14 ‚ö° Meanwhile, the listing price is $0.34 . üëâ You can make your purchase easily right on the TCV Platform: ‚ùó Note: You need to connect your wallet, choose Arbitrum Network, and buy $TCV with $USDT The early $TCV bought will be recorded in our Smart Contract, you can claim your tokens when $TCV is officially listed. The amount of $TCV available to be claimed will be based on the rate of Token Generate Event (TGE), which is set at 10% . Then within 3 months of the vesting term, you can claim all of the $TCV tokens that you have bought in this early seed round. Answers community questions In this AMA, Ms. Haily also revealed important information about this seed sale and $TCV listing through the answers to the community‚Äôs questions.",

    "text": "X Questions: First Question ‚Äî : Could you elaborate on the strategic reasons behind TCV‚Äôs decision to partner with Trava for this Early Seed Round? How does this partnership align with TCV‚Äôs goals and vision for its native token, $TCV? Since the launch of TCV, we‚Äôve maintained a strong connection with the Trava community, and we want to offer the first opportunities to Trava enthusiasts. In this Early Seed Round, anyone involved in the Trava community or using Trava products will have the chance to purchase $TCV at the best possible price. Notably, $TCV is already showing significant growth potential. We believe that the Early Seed Round for the Trava community will pave the way for a successful listing of $TCV. Second Question ‚Äî : I have been participating in Trava for a long time. So how do I qualify to buy? In this Early Seed Round, anyone who joins the Trava community or uses Trava products can buy $TCV at the best price ever: ‚ö°Ô∏è $0.14 ‚ö°Ô∏è Meanwhile, the listing price is $0.34 üöÄ Third Question ‚Äî : How does TCV plan to manage the transition from the Early Seed Round to the public listing of $TCV? What are the key milestones and timelines involved in this transition process? After this early sale, we definitely keep investing efforts and finance sources in TCV products and brand awareness to ensure the growth of the project. We believe this is the core value of the $TCV token, ensuring the safety of buyers who put their trust in us. That being said, we target to achieve a great number of users and expand our partnership to wider Web3 communities, before listing $TCV. And this process is accelerating, so stay tuned! Especially, this Early Seed Sale has sold almost half of $TCV volume within just 1 day! This is a good sign for the potential of $TCV token.",

Then, the terrible Dragons of the North came. Led by the Elder Wyrms, they rent lands with their teeth and claws, burnt cities with their fiery breath and ravaged the forests with their wings. Wherever the Dragons went, death followed suit. Fear and panic spreaded throughout Trava Kingdom, and the land once overflowing with life now barren, wasted and desolated. Before long, the Dragons had scourged all cities and villages of Trava Kingdom but the Sacred Citadel, Middangeard, where lay the Lending Pool, the lifesource of Trava Kingdom itself. The brief respite afforded the Kingdom was but fleeting, and the final days drew nigh‚Ä¶ In the darkest hours, King Svitanae walked to the Lending Pool, with the Holy Scepter tight in hand. ‚ÄúI summon thee, Goddess of the Pool. Heed my word, and deliver us from inevitable doom. Come, Viviane!‚Äù. A vague silhouette appeared, radiating a bright aura that shone upon the castle not unlike midsummer noon. The Goddess Viviane appeared, bringing along her solemn voice: ‚ÄúThe Champion hath been reincarnated, and he shall be the one who endeth the Dragons‚Äô reign.‚Äù At the same moment, an enigmatic voice echoed throughout the Kingdom. ‚ÄúLegends of the Land, heed thine King‚Äôs call. Gather thyself at the Citadel, and thou shall be blessed by my power.‚Äù Men of all ages gathered at Middangeard, and without exception, each was granted a Trava Knight Armor set, blessed by Viviane power through the Lending Pool. The new Order of the Holy Knight of Trava was thus formed, and the hundred-year Draconic War thus began. Until the prophesied Champion of the Crystal would arrive‚Ä¶ The Epic of Trava Knights - Chapter Model Collection",

    "text": "Trava Station coming to Testnet: The transit point of convenience: Published in 5 min readAug 24, 2023 Share After a period of preparation, we have launched Trava Station on Testnet today ‚Äî 24th August. This new product marks another step in the evolution of Trava Finance, closer to fulfilling our goal of a convenient and seamless DeFi environment. The first Testnet version of Trava Station comes with two features: Freight and Portfolio. After testing and collecting user opinions, Tramlines and Junction will be added, preparing for the release on Mainnet. Trava Station is live on Testnet You can continue with the content below to understand more about Trava Station and the 2 features that have been launched. We‚Äôll also go over the benefits of Trava Station again, providing a few small examples of the fee difference between using Trava Station and not. Check out Trava Station here: https://app.trava.finance/station Freight As in the published content, this is a feature that allows users to combine many actions in the Trava Finance ecosystem into a single transaction. Trava Freight allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands, with simple options like drag and drop, click‚Ä¶ to put actions into a route. After that, you just need to fill in the corresponding necessary parameters and you‚Äôre done, for example as shown in the image below. Currently in this Testnet version, Freight allows basic actions and interactions with Trava Finance‚Äôs Lending Pools, BNB chain‚Ä¶ We are still continuing to polish the product, adding more actions related to NFT and launching together in the Mainnet version. Of course, we won‚Äôt stop just there, but will develop Freight even more in the future. So if you have any suggestion, say it so we Trava team can check and maybe work on them. Portfolio In order for Trava Station and its features to work smoothly, we integrated Smart Wallet in our system, with more detailed information can be found in our previous article. You will be asked to create a Smart Wallet the first time joining Trava Station, and it will act as an intermediary for all your actions, temporarily holding your assets. To make it easier for you to track Smart Wallet position and assets, we have added the Portfolio feature. This feature will display your position in the Lending Pool when you use Smart Wallet to perform actions in the pools in the Trava ecosystem. Or if you create an order to sell Armoury items, Portfolio will display those NFTs for sale, and the amount of money you have in your Smart Wallet from the sale. With more actions and features added in the future, the Portfolio page will also show more user information and details related to the Station. Upcoming features As mentioned in the product ideas overview in our Forum, Trava Station has a total of 4 main features in plan. In addition to the two mentioned above will be in this Testnet version, we also intend to bring Tramlines and Junction in the future. * Among them, the former is a collection of pre-made routes with actions that are commonly used. We will soon make an announcement on consulting users about Tramlines, so stay tuned to not miss it. * Meanwhile, the Junction feature is for routes that work in the future ‚Äî they won‚Äôt run when created like with Freight. You can specify one or some conditions, and a system bot will monitor them and execute them when the parameters are reached. For example, you can set actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price gets to $1000 ‚Äî this threshold appearing will signal our system bot to execute the pre-arranged actions. The benefits Trava Station is intended to reduce both the time you spend switching between Trava platforms, and the fee of making multiple transactions. Normally, to accomplish a certain goal such as staking into Trava Finance‚Äôs Vault, you will have to supply, swap and stake in turn. It seems easy with just a few actions, but there can be times when the goal requires up to a dozen, each happening on different platforms, wasting you a lot of precious time. That‚Äôs not to mention the amount of fees you have to pay to perform separate transactions ‚Äî because usually you cannot execute another action if you have a pending one. But now with Trava Station, things will become much simpler and more economical, when various actions can be combined into a single transaction. The fee difference Here are a few example actions to show the difference between the fee you will spend using Trava Station versus not using it: * 2 actions: If you perform repay (token DAI) and withdraw (token AAVE) in Trava Station, the cost will be 0.001530189 BNB ‚Äî 10.83% less than the normal gas fee of 0.001716111 BNB. * 3 actions: If you supply (USDC token), borrow (TRAVA token) and then withdraw (AAVE token), the savings will be nearly 18% ‚Äî down from 0.002695095 to 0.002210151 (BNB). * 4 actions: With actions like supply (USDC token), borrow (TRAVA token), repay (DAI token) and withdraw (AAVE token), normally the gas fee will be 0.003372765 BNB. But with Trava Station, it will decrease to 0.002767023 BNB ‚Äî 17.96%. NOTE ‚ÄºÔ∏è All the above parameters are just examples at the time we test the product, there will be fluctuations when users actually use it. Conclusion Overall, Trava Station is only in Testnet now and has a long way to go. We will constantly continue to modify and add more features to further develop this product, finally releasing it on Mainnet. In our vision, Trava Station is hoped to become the transit point of convenience for our community. From the very beginning, the goal of Trava Finance has always been to create a seamless and easy DeFi environment for users ‚Äî we will not stop on the way there. üåüSo let‚Äôs check out Trava Station here: https://app.trava.finance/station ** About Trava.Finance Trava Finance is the world‚Äôs first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending.** While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, Trava Finance offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. Trava Finance is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks.

    "text": "MINI AMA RECAP ‚Äî TRAVA x TCV: EXPLORE TCV‚ÄôS EARLY SEED ROUND: Published in 6 min readSep 17, 2024 Share On September 13th, 2024, Trava Finance and TCV hosted a Mini AMA to help explore all the opportunities and benefits in TCV‚Äôs Early Seed Round. This event was organized on the Trava Telegram channel, stirring great excitement of the community. With the honored presence of Ms. Hailey, Tech Lead of TCV, this small AMA meeting provided crucial information about TCV‚Äôs Early Seed Round and addressed the audience‚Äôs questions. The event covered 3 main sections: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview of TCV‚Äôs present product and tokenomics. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Mechanism and instructions for purchasing TCV. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Community questions. Let‚Äôs dive into the discussions! Overview of TCV‚Äôs present product and tokenomics First Question: TCV has undergone a long development process. Could you update the present products of TCV platform to our community, please? TCV is developing as an AI platform enabling liquidity strategies provision for DeFi on DEX V3 & Lending pool on multi-chains. At present, the platform provides 5 pools on Arbitrum 1 , corresponding to those of Uniswap . üìå More importantly, only when providing liquidity on TCV vaults, users can maximize their liquidity with our optimized APR and manage their liquidity in an automated, capital-efficient, non-custodial, and transparent manner. üåü Now, here are the pools that have the best APR optimized on TCV platform üëâ You can take a closer look at these pools and join them: Second Question: Your project already has a clear tokenomics for your native token ‚Äî $TCV, right? So what is the potential it holds for $TCV? Unlike other nonsense tokens, $TCV is listed to serve the long-term journey of TCV products. Our current plan for this token focuses on two main objectives: Governance and Fee Payments within the Protocol. üìç The total supply of $TCV is capped at 168 million tokens, with an initial market cap of $200,000 . The tokens will be distributed across seven categories shown in the tokenomics below. üî• Especially, the Early Seed Round of $TCV, part of the Seed Sale, represents just 0.1% of the total supply, offering an exclusive opportunity to purchase $TCV at an optimal price.‚Äù üìç Additionally, the $TOD treasury will be recognized as part of the tokens sold in the Private Sale round for $TCV, ensuring that the rights of $TOD holders are fully protected. Mechanism and instructions for purchasing TCV Third Question: TCV‚Äôs Early Seed Round for Trava Finance was kicked off yesterday! What is the objective of this event? Well, our Early Seed Round is a seed sale program, selling $TCV early at good prices for limited communities or individuals. This program starts first with Trava members, offering the best price of $TCV ever ( ~60% lower than the listing pric e) üöÄ Initiating with the Trava community, this event will pave the way for the listing of $TCV üöÄ Fourth question: Can you explain to Trava members how to join this early seed sale, please? In this Early Seed Round, anyone who joins the Trava community or uses Trava products can buy $TCV at ‚ö° ONLY $0.14 ‚ö° Meanwhile, the listing price is $0.34 . üëâ You can make your purchase easily right on the TCV Platform: ‚ùó Note: You need to connect your wallet, choose Arbitrum Network, and buy $TCV with $USDT The early $TCV bought will be recorded in our Smart Contract, you can claim your tokens when $TCV is officially listed. The amount of $TCV available to be claimed will be based on the rate of Token Generate Event (TGE), which is set at 10% . Then within 3 months of the vesting term, you can claim all of the $TCV tokens that you have bought in this early seed round. Answers community questions In this AMA, Ms. Haily also revealed important information about this seed sale and $TCV listing through the answers to the community‚Äôs questions.",

    "text": "X Questions: First Question ‚Äî : Could you elaborate on the strategic reasons behind TCV‚Äôs decision to partner with Trava for this Early Seed Round? How does this partnership align with TCV‚Äôs goals and vision for its native token, $TCV? Since the launch of TCV, we‚Äôve maintained a strong connection with the Trava community, and we want to offer the first opportunities to Trava enthusiasts. In this Early Seed Round, anyone involved in the Trava community or using Trava products will have the chance to purchase $TCV at the best possible price. Notably, $TCV is already showing significant growth potential. We believe that the Early Seed Round for the Trava community will pave the way for a successful listing of $TCV. Second Question ‚Äî : I have been participating in Trava for a long time. So how do I qualify to buy? In this Early Seed Round, anyone who joins the Trava community or uses Trava products can buy $TCV at the best price ever: ‚ö°Ô∏è $0.14 ‚ö°Ô∏è Meanwhile, the listing price is $0.34 üöÄ Third Question ‚Äî : How does TCV plan to manage the transition from the Early Seed Round to the public listing of $TCV? What are the key milestones and timelines involved in this transition process? After this early sale, we definitely keep investing efforts and finance sources in TCV products and brand awareness to ensure the growth of the project. We believe this is the core value of the $TCV token, ensuring the safety of buyers who put their trust in us. That being said, we target to achieve a great number of users and expand our partnership to wider Web3 communities, before listing $TCV. And this process is accelerating, so stay tuned! Especially, this Early Seed Sale has sold almost half of $TCV volume within just 1 day! This is a good sign for the potential of $TCV token.",

Creating a user-friendly landing page is one of the priorities for better user experience. Additionally, Trava Finance lending product team should start working on adding more tokens to \"Token Health\" so they could be added to pool creation once the product is 100% finished - having more tokens available for pool creation feature is an advantage to attract more userbase and investors. Lastly, I like the (idea 4.) - creating more DeFi investment options to explore in DeFi Cryptospace is great for expanding community knowledge about investment possibilities and also making the BRicher tool more flexible. Having more protocols/chains/networks to choose from can expand the use-case of the tool. *",

I also am concerned with the exposure to BNB. These past few months have shown there could be a collapse of the chain if its ever found that Binance is having financial difficulties or serious legal issues. I feel we should maybe increase our exposure to just ETH and BTC instead and minority stake in BNB. Also it may be wise to follow what Iron Bank has done and keep adding more networks for the platform use. Avax, Algo, etc., in case BNB falls it won't harm Trava as bad. Currently most of the transactions on Trava are on the BNB chain. FTM is great on Trava, but the ETH chain is having issues and is the most expensive way to make defi transactions. *",

Creating a user-friendly landing page is one of the priorities for better user experience.

Kel 8 May 2023, 16:59 * RE: What will it take for the TOD price to recover? posted in Reserve Currency Hey @jefe811, nice question. Let me expand here a little.. **Why TOD Token price has decreased?** The TOD asset value has plummeted due to multiple reasons. 1. Whitelist wallet allocations attract P&D users who do not intend to hold assets for longer periods of time and most of the time dump their assets once Token is launched for trading. 2. BSC Network overall is more oriented to giveaway/airdrop hunters, IDO/ICO (whitelist) hunters, P&D, early benefit/incentive users who leave after competition or event is over. Due to low gas fees. 3. Narrative on DAO's in Crypto Space is pretty shaky with examples like OHM; TIME; plummeting even harder. Investors adapt and learn during the course of the cycle, thus, many users just stay away from DAO's as they have a negative example happening previously. 4. Single wallet has made a big purchase during the launch and has dumped it's Tokens after whitelist allocations have started being unlocked. Users take advantage of Token listings sometimes creating fake hype or even FOMO by pushing the price up significantly, expecting more users to join in the buying frenzy then later using them as exit liquidity. 5. More and more users tend to realize their profits immediately, especially during bull run within the market cycle, rather than taking the longer route and accumulating the bag over the course of upcoming years. That is why even some of the whitelist allocations were sold of after unlock. **What gives value to Tokens? What affects the price?** * Utility (Crypto token that serves some use case within a specific ecosystem) * Supply and demand (The higher the demand and lower the supply, the higher the price and vice versa) * Cost of production (PoW / PoS. Equipment or assets needed to generate more assets and their costs) * Environment Conditions (BTC for now is always the father/papa of crypto assets prices, ETH has also influence for altcoins usually. That means if BTC drops -> ETH drops -> altcoins drop and vice versa) * Local Conditions (Referring to local network recent PA, narrative, news - (TOD is launched on BSC-Binance Smart Chain)) * Competition (If a new competitor gains momentum, it takes value from the existing competition, thus sending the price of the incumbent down as the new competitor's token sees its price move higher) * Governance (Stable governance where things are relatively hard to change can be of value by providing more stable pricing) * Availability on exchanges (If a cryptocurrency becomes listed on more exchanges, it can increase the number of investors willing and able to buy it, thus increasing demand) * Power of the media (Good news can certainly increase it, while bad news can cause panic) * Financial crises (Economic situation in the world) Which ever crypto asset or project you will do research on the main factor will always be Supply and demand. If there is no demand within investor base, no new holders - the price will decrease if the token is inflationary as supply is increasing constantly. **Utility** and **power of the media** can create demand and **being unique** from competitors gives an additional edge in the Crypto game. That is why TOD still has additional utility yet to be implemented like becoming an asset available to Lend/Borrow in Trava Lending Pools. TOD is also planned to be integrated to Trava NFT Program. And currently we can see Wallet Reputation and user loyalty being taken into account which will benefit higher rank users/wallets with better Bonding discounts, higher APY%, option to take bigger debts via Bonding Installment and longer repayment periods and more benefits in the future too. To wrap this up, I would like everyone to look at DeFi more than just actual today price of the Token and simple trading - that usually means you overinvested or bought at ATH and are expecting for the price to return. By staking, bonding, rebasing your assets you are able to grow your portfolio and outweigh your losses which might have happened due to recent negative price action. Personally, even with current TOD price and \"plummeting\" chart, playing the Game Theory with rebase TOD Token and Bonds allowed me to stay stable with supply increase and price decrease and actually being in profit today. This eventually becomes an additional passive income source where your daily stake/rebase rewards can be sold off as profit while the amount staked/rebasing does not change, finding this balance of reward ratio. Kel 19 Apr 2022, 16:55 * RE: More Exchanges posted in For Beginners Hello @sir-kuana. Unfortunately, we cannot comment on any potential exchange listing platform or timeline. What we can confirm is that negotiations are happening and new CEX listing is always in plans, but requires good market conditions and approvals from both parties first, the exchange and the project. Kraken Listing on Kraken Exchange is pretty much impossible, they do not list Tokens randomly and the asset count available is low compared to other exchanges plus most of them are 100 Top assets. Etoro Same as Kraken, the asset size list available for trading is low and only selected few are available. Again at least 100 Top Tokens. Gate Exchange could theoretically damage the price of TRAVA Token due to airdrops for their exchange users, which they dump immediately after event is completed, plus projects have to donate Tokens for this event. MEXC and Bitmart listing are a perfect example. Plus Gate is not that renown, there are better exchanges to look at. LBank Same logic as Gate. Binance and KuCoin These two exchanges are more likely to be on the list for the Trava Team to do negotiations with. Though listings on both exchanges are quite costly. But if I had to guess, these two exchanges are more likely to happen than any of the above.

How come that you are considering meme tokens as addition to Lending Pool assets? and ? AVAX; XLM; TRX; LTC; LINK - I would suggest to have a discussion about these assets as next addition to the Trava Lending Pools. Kel 20 Apr 2022, 21:52 * RE: Defi hacking and the security of TRAVA posted in Technical Support Hey @jefe811. Yes, security is one of the most important factors overall in Crypto Space nowadays and especially in DeFi Space as well with lots of other finance projects getting hacked / \"hacked\" or even rugging. That is why security has always been the top priority for Trava Finance and 2 audits were completed prior to even launching Lending Pools, Staking Vaults. Attaching relevant audit information below, you can find the reports from both audit projects as well. * Hacken Medium: * Hacken report: (there is a download button near Trava Finance audit) * CertiK Medium: * CertiK report: I would like to point out that contract codes which have auto-top ups / Token reimbursements coded are usually the ones which are more susceptible to hack attacks. That is why Trava Finance tops up contracts running out of Tokens, like bridge, staking vaults, LP vaults, lending contracts, manually by setting up notification bots to alert relevant Team members to complete the top-up. Additionally, Team is constantly reading the latest news and hacks happening in Crypto Space and investigating contract code particularities which were the point of attack. Another point - Trava Finance does not support flash loans due to flash loan attack possibilities, but other projects like AAVE do support them. That is why we do not see TRAVA as an asset within Lending Pools as using other project protocols it could lead to TRAVA's Token price downfall if it were to be used in flash loan attack scheme. I would also like to invite @ducTrava to share his knowledge and clear any doubts about Trava Finance DeFi security.

For now regular Bonding with USDT is available Kel 20 Apr 2022, 15:26 * RE: $TRAVA adding to the Lending Pool as collateral posted in Lending Hey @mazz086. Indeed having $TRAVA as an asset to be able to Lend/Borrow via Lending Pools would provide the necessary utility. However as @theunreal has mentioned above, TRAVA Token cannot be added as an asset to Lending Pools as of this moment at least due a few reasons. Trava Finance does not support flash loans in Lending Pools, but other project protocols like AAVE do. By staging a flash loan attack via other project protocols users could destroy TRAVA price like it happened with CREAM for example. Current low price, current low circulating supply does not allow TRAVA to be an asset in Lending Pools quite yet. But that is why TraDAO ($TOD) should take it's place in the near future as an asset to be available for Lend/Borrow since it's backed up by a Treasury controlled by TraDAO protocol itself.

Would be great if you could read information from the wallet after authenticating it on BRicher, to list already used strategies. Additionally, future strategies should include arbitrage trading possibilities listed with other DeFi Lending Protocols.

Unfortunately, we cannot comment on any potential exchange listing platform or timeline. What we can confirm is that negotiations are happening and new CEX listing is always in plans, but requires good market conditions and approvals from both parties first, the exchange and the project. Kraken Listing on Kraken Exchange is pretty much impossible, they do not list Tokens randomly and the asset count available is low compared to other exchanges plus most of them are 100 Top assets. Etoro Same as Kraken, the asset size list available for trading is low and only selected few are available. Again at least 100 Top Tokens. Gate Exchange could theoretically damage the price of TRAVA Token due to airdrops for their exchange users, which they dump immediately after event is completed, plus projects have to donate Tokens for this event. MEXC and Bitmart listing are a perfect example. Plus Gate is not that renown, there are better exchanges to look at. LBank Same logic as Gate. Binance and KuCoin These two exchanges are more likely to be on the list for the Trava Team to do negotiations with. Though listings on both exchanges are quite costly. But if I had to guess, these two exchanges are more likely to happen than any of the above.

Could you please describe how would you intend to use Treasury funds to make profitable investments. As I understand the Treasury main task it be a reserve for Buyback in-case $TOD price drops to critical levels - 1$. Other Treasuries are used for Development ant Technological advancements, like paying wages/salaries. Distributing a portion of it to Community, Marketing as well. I am interested to hear what do you mean by use the money in the Treasury to make profitable investments, please explain and provide suggestions or examples. Kel 27 Apr 2022, 17:30 * RE: $TRAVA adding to the Lending Pool as collateral posted in Lending Hey @mazz086. Indeed having $TRAVA as an asset to be able to Lend/Borrow via Lending Pools would provide the necessary utility. However as @theunreal has mentioned above, TRAVA Token cannot be added as an asset to Lending Pools as of this moment at least due a few reasons. Trava Finance does not support flash loans in Lending Pools, but other project protocols like AAVE do. By staging a flash loan attack via other project protocols users could destroy TRAVA price like it happened with CREAM for example. Current low price, current low circulating supply does not allow TRAVA to be an asset in Lending Pools quite yet. But that is why TraDAO ($TOD) should take it's place in the near future as an asset to be available for Lend/Borrow since it's backed up by a Treasury controlled by TraDAO protocol itself. Kel 25 Apr 2022, 16:35 * RE: Defi hacking and the security of TRAVA posted in Technical Support Hey @jefe811. Yes, security is one of the most important factors overall in Crypto Space nowadays and especially in DeFi Space as well with lots of other finance projects getting hacked / \"hacked\" or even rugging. That is why security has always been the top priority for Trava Finance and 2 audits were completed prior to even launching Lending Pools, Staking Vaults. Attaching relevant audit information below, you can find the reports from both audit projects as well. * Hacken Medium: * Hacken report: (there is a download button near Trava Finance audit) * CertiK Medium: * CertiK report: I would like to point out that contract codes which have auto-top ups / Token reimbursements coded are usually the ones which are more susceptible to hack attacks. That is why Trava Finance tops up contracts running out of Tokens, like bridge, staking vaults, LP vaults, lending contracts, manually by setting up notification bots to alert relevant Team members to complete the top-up. Additionally, Team is constantly reading the latest news and hacks happening in Crypto Space and investigating contract code particularities which were the point of attack. Another point - Trava Finance does not support flash loans due to flash loan attack possibilities, but other projects like AAVE do support them. That is why we do not see TRAVA as an asset within Lending Pools as using other project protocols it could lead to TRAVA's Token price downfall if it were to be used in flash loan attack scheme. I would also like to invite @ducTrava to share his knowledge and clear any doubts about Trava Finance DeFi security.

I would suggest delegating some time reading through abracadabra.money and their concept behind Lend/Borrow and collateral. As TOD is planned to be added as an asset for Trava Lending Pools, using staked version of TOD -> xTOD (rebasing TOD) for collateral would still grow in value or at least maintain the current value. Otherwise if TOD has to be unstaked in order to be Lended/Borrowed, it might decrease in value as it's not rebasing anymore, making Lend/Borrow feature somewhat irrelevant.

First on coingecko chart looks dead/ we dont have even info about tod pair on site coingecko. People dont have idea about existing tod atm. No marketing on social media about tod. Second. Also you promised keeping 1usd price of tod. You dont make it cuz we had bearmarket but its time to proof it in bullrun and make tod great again. 1 Reply Last reply * last edited by There are 2 options imo: 50k is ideal, but some attention is needed to get there. Maybe some extra attention or a nice reward in $TOD? 20k possible with some low attention. Under 20k is a pity imo. 1 Reply Last reply * last edited by To make the TRAVA/TOD pair, the liquidity values need to be equalized between the two pairs. My suggestion and TOD is the same TVL as TRAVA, but if it doesn't reach 50k, it's the minimum. We need more incentives for TOD, the market doesn't know it. However, we need the TRAVA token to gain more traction and consequently the market will view TOD positively. 1 Reply Last reply * last edited by Hi, In the case of lacking target TVL, do you have any suggest for this?

    "text": "Figure 1: Main features of TRAVA.FINANCE TRAVA.FINANCE (or TRAVA) is the world‚Äôs first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrowing/lending interest rate, liquidity threshold, Loan to Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA.FINANCE offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA.FINANCE is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks. The pool owners, who are an additional role to lenders and borrowers, can receive more earnings by devising a good lending strategy for their pools. Moreover, to reduce risks and stimulate lending and borrowing, TRAVA.FINANCE performs cross-chain data analysis on multiple blockchain networks to (i) recommend optimal pool parameters for pool owners and (ii) detect unusual transactions in their pools. The lending marketplace model of TRAVA.FINANCE will increase crypto liquidity and promote the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. There are six salient features of TRAVA.FINANCE, including: * **Crypto lending marketplace** : TRAVA.FINANCE creates a **marketplace** in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and obtain greater earnings. * **Semantic knowledge graph** : TRAVA.FINANCE is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA.FINANCE to efficiently search for useful information such as (i) the amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses; (ii) the provenance of an NFT; (iii) aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc. * **Data analysis** : To reduce lending risks, TRAVA.FINANCE performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA.FINANCE recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, Loan to Value ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA.FINANCE also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools. * **Credit score evaluation** : Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can (i) reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool; and (ii) stimulate borrowing by defining a high Loan to Value ratio for borrowers with high credit scores. * **Cross-chain identification and cross-chain lending** : TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross- chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores. * **NFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals** : To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA.FINANCE allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn considerable amounts from the contract. NextArchitecture Last updated 1 year ago Was this helpful?",

    "text": "Figure 2: TRAVA.FINANCE'S Architecture TRAVA.FINANCE is divided into two main layers: TRAVA.FINANCE marketplace and TRAVA.FINANCE Foundation. The former uses the protocols and the cross-chain knowledge graph provided by the latter so that end-users can interact with TRAVA.FINANCE marketplace and perform their lending functionalities. _TRAVA.FINANCE marketplace_ offers three lending roles for end-users. In other approaches, end-users can only participate in the lending business as either borrowers or lenders. In the TRAVA.FINANCE _marketplace_ , pool owners may play the additional role for them to start their own lending business and obtain greater earnings. To this end, they create and maintain their own lending pool. TRAVA.FINANCE performs blockchain data analysis to help them adapt optimal pool parameters to their lending strategy. In order for lenders, borrowers, and pool owners to perform lending business operations, TRAVA.FINANCE develops smart contracts divided into 5 groups: (1) Pool parameter optimization, (2) Cross-chain digital asset evaluation, (3) Credit score evaluation, (4) Digital asset (NFT, stoke token, etc.) auction-based pricing, and (5) Data analysis. These smart contracts are deployed on all nodes in the TRAVA.FINANCE network. To enable cross-chain lending, _TRAVA.FINANCE_ marketplace also includes ‚ÄúCross-chain Digital Asset Management‚Äù smart contracts, which interact with users‚Äô digital assets on multiple blockchain networks. The smart contracts allow TRAVA.FINANCE to query users‚Äô balance, aggregate their cryptos, or lock their certain amount of cryptos. These cross-chain interactions require a network of validators to participate in to collect, confirm, and verify cross-chain data. TRAVA.FINANCE marketplace makes use of TRAVA.FINANCE foundation to communicate with other blockchain networks and implement the lending functionalities offered to end-users. TRAVA.FINANCE foundation is built on the hyper-linked datachain protocol. It uses three ToVChain's protocols, including (1) Data exchange protocol to enable interactions between TRAVA.FINANCE and other blockchain networks, (2) Data linking protocol to enrich the cross- chain knowledge graph with linked financial data collected from multiple chains, and (3) Cross- chain identification protocol to identify the same owner of multiple wallet addresses on single or multiple blockchain networks and thus facilitate fast and efficient mortgage placement. TRAVA.FINANCE foundation also uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to perform data analysis and evaluate users‚Äô credit scores. The knowledge graph is presented in the next section.

    "text": "Figure 3: An example of the cross-chain knowledge graph The knowledge graph is one of the most fundamental components of TRAVA.FINANCE, which is responsible for storing and representing aggregated data from multiple blockchain networks. The graph and TRAVA.FINANCE protocols make independent blockchains interconnected and create the internet of hyper-linked blockchains, allowing DApps to address complex business in reality. Figure 3 shows an example of the knowledge graph. The circle represents an entity (or instance) of data such as a wallet address, a user, a lending pool, an NFT, or other types of digital assets. Each entity is associated with other entities in certain relationships, represented by directional arrows; the direction of an arrow is the direction of the relationship. The white rectangles are the values for the data attributes of the entity. The example graph shows that the WalletAddress2 is on the Ethereum network and that address owns an NFT. Aggregated information of the NFT, such as the highest bid price, number of auctions, list of addresses ever owned, etc., are also represented in the knowledge graph. Let us assume that a user creates one address on the Bitcoin network and one address on the Ethereum network. Because there were no relationships among these addresses, the knowledge graph creates two anonymous users, i.e., AnonymousUser1 and AnonymousUser2. AnonymousUser1 owns the Bitcoin addresses (i.e., WalletAddress3), and AnonymousUser2 has one Ethereum address, i.e., WalletAddress1. Various information related to a wallet address is stored in the graph. For example, the WalletAddress3 entity contains the _average balance_ , the _total amount of ETHs transferred in and out_ , the _total number of transactions_ , or _the average, median, mode,_ and _highest number of ETHs transferred in one transaction._ Assuming the user wants to increase his/her credit score or use up all of his/her cryptos as collateral for a loan, he or she can unify all addresses as one via the cross-chain identification protocol performed in only one TRAVA.FINANCE's transaction. After completing the transaction, the two anonymous users are linked by the _sameAs_ relationship. Depending on users‚Äô needs, the cross-chain identification protocol also supports linking two wallet address entities by a _guarantee_ relationship. Once an address is lost, if all the addresses that guarantee the address confirm the loss, the address status will be claimed as _lost_ in the knowledge graph. Wallet addresses can also be connected by a _transfer_ relationship. To ensure scalability, rather than detailed transactions, statistical and aggregated information on transactions is calculated and stored in that _transfer_ relationship. As in the knowledge graph example above, several remarkable pieces of information are saved, including _BlockchainAddress1 has transferred 400 ETHs in total to BlockchainAddress2; it is performed through 10 transactions, and the largest transaction transfers 200 ETHs._ To avoid junk addresses and junk digital assets, we do not store all blockchain entities in the knowledge graph. The number of transactions or the maximum of cryptos transferred in one transaction related to an NFT or an address needs to surpass a threshold so that the NFT and the address will be added to the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph can also represent other types of entities, relationships, and properties. We develop a unified interface so that the expansion of the knowledge graph can be done in a logical, consistent, effective, scalable, and standardized manner. As the knowledge graph plays a crucial role, it can only be updated by a TRAVA.FINANCE‚Äôs validator, and this must be agreed upon by other validators on the network. The knowledge graph needs to be infinitely extended while the assigned number of TRAVA.FINANCEs is fixed and finite. Thus it is not possible to pay fees for updating the graph. However, there should also be a way to encourage validators to update and enrich the knowledge graph. To reconcile this contradiction, TRAVA.FINANCE requires and also encourages validators to update the knowledge graph. On the one hand, validators must update the knowledge graph regularly, otherwise, they will be stripped of their validator role, and cannot earn rewards for appending new blocks or verifying transactions. On the other hand, each time enriching the knowledge graph, validators will gain the fame score, thereby gaining more priorities and indirectly having the opportunity to earn more TRAVA.FINANCE coins when joining the network. Priorities may include voting power or the privilege to unlock TRAVA.FINANCE tokens earlier than the standard time when receiving awards. Enriching the graph is a special kind of TRAVA.FINANCE transaction that requires no fee. Out of all transactions, graph-related transactions are extracted and stored separately in files along with their hash value. This allows validators and other nodes to (re)construct the graph more efficiently with their own graph database systems.

    "text": "Figure 4: Cross-chain identification: The cross-chain identification protocol plays an important role in the TRAVA.FINANCE architecture. It can be used to verify that multiple addresses on different chains belong to the same user. The protocol allows TRAVA.FINANCE to provide an overview of anonymous users, including their total cryptos and other digital assets, statistics for their transactions, and their relationships with other blockchain addresses. These types of information and relationships are stored on the cross-chain knowledge graph. The protocol can (i) improve the credit score of the users and their wallet address so that they can get favorable interest rates, (ii) save them transaction fees since they can use up all of their cryptos as collateral in a single transaction, and (iii) allow them to get their cryptos back when they lose one of their wallet address. To implement the protocol, we develop a wallet application so that users can manage their accounts and prove their ownership of multiple accounts. The application provides users with two functionalities: ‚ÄúAdd account‚Äù and ‚ÄúCreate a proof of ownership‚Äù. Users can add a new account to the wallet application in multiple ways, e.g., (i) create an account, (ii) import a private key, and (iii) connect to a hardware wallet. To foster their DeFi transactions, they might need to prove that they are the owner of n addresses. To this end, they can use our wallet application to perform a transaction that activates the cross-chain identification protocol. Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators check the accuracy of the data associated with the transaction. If the data is valid, the validators accept the transaction and write the sameAs relationship among the owners of the addresses to the knowledge graph. In the following we describe our processing to verify the cross-chain identification of multiple wallet addresses.",

    "text": "In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. TRAVA.FINANCE uses credit scores to ensure the safety of the lending process. Pool owners and lenders can rate borrowers‚Äô credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. Based on the credit scores, they can determine the maximum Loan-To-Value ratio for borrowers. Borrowers with high credit scores get preferential treatment; they can borrow cryptos with more favorable interest rates and Loan-To-Value ratios. Credit scores provide an incentive for users to (i) hold their wallet addresses as long as possible and keep them clean, (ii) perform the cross-chain identification protocol to interlink their addresses, (iii) perform more transactions inside and outside TRAVA.FINANCE, and so on. This increases crypto liquidity and fosters the growth of the DeFi system. The credit score evaluation in TRAVA.FINANCE is primarily based on on-chain data. At present, we collect, enrich, and analyze Binance Smart Chain transactions, including the native transferring transactions and the transactions to deposit, withdraw, repay, and borrow tokens generated from Binance Smart Chain lending DApps. TRAVA.FINANCE evaluates credit scores for both wallet addresses and other digital assets. Wallet addresses operated for a long time with good transaction history (e.g., an address that has transactions with many other addresses, always pays debts on time, and performs transactions frequently) will have a high credit score. Pool owners can use credit scores as a criterion to select competent wallet addresses for their pool‚Äôs liquidity providers. The credit rating of digital assets helps pool owners and liquid providers to minimize liquidity risk. TRAVA.FINANCE divides digital assets into two categories: Tokens/coins and other digital assets (e.g., NFT, smart contracts, stoke tokens) and evaluates their credit scores. The credit score of a **Token** is assessed based on 4 parameters, i.e., (i) the token price, (ii) the market cap (MC) of the token, (iii) the token trading volume, and (iv) the number of transactions related to the token. High-credit-score tokens have a great advantage over low-credit-score tokens. Once being used as collaterals, they offer high loan-to-value ratios to borrowers; lenders also get favorable lending interest rates with their high-credit-score tokens. Users can improve their credit scores once they possess those high-valuable digital assets. TRAVA.FINANCE also performs credit ratings for other **digital assets such as NFT**. The credit scores for NFTs are estimated based on the number of times that they have been auctioned on TRAVA.FINANCE or other trusted platforms. NFTs‚Äô scores should not depend on their price because their price is typically determined in an unreliable manner, based on the emotion and the preference of customers. To evaluate credit scores for a wallet address, TRAVA.FINANCE credit scoring model will take into account the following factors: * _Total asset_. The total asset represents the financial strength of the wallet address; it is the most intuitive and easiest-to-evaluate parameter. It is also the second most important parameter that affects credit scores. The total asset is the sum of balance and total investment minus total liabilities. The credit score of the address is proportional to its total asset. As this parameter is a volatility index, the credit score is calculated based on both the _average total asset_ in a certain period and the _total current asset_. * _Transaction history_. Transaction history is the most important parameter; it has a major impact on credit scores. TRAVA.FINANCE collects and aggregates all exchanges, loans, deposits, and other transactions of the wallet address across multiple DApps to calculate various intermediate parameters such as (i) the age of the address, (ii) its transaction amount, (iii) its frequency of transaction, (iv) its number of liquidations and (v) its total value of liquidations. * _Loan ratios_. Loan ratios (debt ratios) represent the debt position of the account. It is divided into two sub-parameters, i.e., loan-to-balance ratio and loan-to-investment ratio. * _Circulating assets_. This parameter represents how active users are in the crypto market. The more money they invest in the crypto market, the more creditworthiness they gain from others. This parameter is evaluated based on 2 sub-parameters, (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE (Return on equity). * _Trustworthiness of possessing assets_. The last parameter for credit rating is the trustworthiness of the assets owned by the wallet address. The wallet can improve its credit score by possessing high-value and trustworthy digital assets. At present, TRAVA.FINANCE evaluates two types of digital assets only (i.e, Token and NFT). PreviousCross-chain IdentificationNextCollateralized NFTs Last updated 3 years ago Was this helpful?",

    "text": "NFT has become an increasingly popular way to buy and sell digital artwork. They are non-fungible, which naturally means that they are illiquid. Bringing liquidity to the NFT space would unlock a myriad of possibilities. As of May 2021, there have been no lending projects that make use of NFT as collaterals, because unlike a fungible currency or common stock, NFT value is difficult to determine. TRAVA.FINANCE adds more flexibility to the illiquid world of NFT and allows NFT owners to earn an ROI without selling it. TRAVA.FINANCE offers an innovative feature that prices NFTs based on auctions. After the auction, borrowers can use their NFTs as collateral. TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT. Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back. The auction process is as follows: 1. The NFT owner opens an auction session; she sets (i) the legal crypto used in the auction, (ii) the initial price for her NFT, (iii) the countdown time for the auction session, (iv) the mode for her auction (i.e., _auction-to-sell or auction-for-buy-right_), and other auction terms. 2. TRAVA.FINANCE users, who are interested in the NFT, can join in the auction session. To encourage users to participate in auctions, at the end of the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE randomly selects several bidders and rewards them with TRAVA tokens extracted from the auction fees. To guarantee that the bidders make their payment when they win the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE locks a number of their TRAVA tokens as soon as they join in the auction session and make a bid. When the auction finishes, they will immediately get their tokens back if they are not the winner. In case they are the winners, they can get their tokens back only if they pay for the auctioning NFT before the deadline. 3. In the _auction-to-sell_ mode, the auction winner will pay the owner the whole auction price to get the NFT. 4. In the _auction-for-buy-right_ mode, the auction winners have to pay a part of the auction price. We name the quotient of the amount the winners have to pay over the auction price \"_auction-paid ratio_ ‚Äù. The auction-paid ratio is calculated from the creditworthiness of the lender, borrower, NFT, and the auction terms. The NFT owners can use the cryptos paid by the auction winner as collateral for their loans. Once they repay their loan including the interest to the auction winners, they can get the NFT back. Otherwise, they will lose their NFT to the auction winners. These rules are all defined in the auction smart contract. TRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below. * **NFT owners** can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it. TRAVA.FINANCE thus increases the liquidity of NFTs and opens up a unique and exciting NFTFi marketplace. * Based on the given number of auction bids, **bidders** have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session. This rewarding mechanism provides incentives for users to actively make a bid in the auction. * **Auction winners** can get their desired NFT at a price lower than their bidding price (once NFT owners cannot repay the loan) or they can receive considerable interest from their loan to NFT owners (once NFT owners repay the loans and get their NFT back). * The credit scores of **NFT owners, auction winners, bidders,** and **NFTs** can be improved after auctions. The auction mechanism for NFT can also be applied to any type of digital asset. In our road map, TRAVA.FINANCE will implement this auction feature for various types of digital assets (e.g., stock token, smart contract).

    "text": "Brief description of Trava: TRAVA is the world‚Äôs first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA also offers the credit score function based on financial data on-chain analysis as a useful tool that reduces risk and increases profits for all users. We build our solutions on TRAVA.FINANCE whose smart contracts are deployed on BSC network, so the speed of transactions, gas fees, and robustness depend on BSC network. However, in the near future, we will allow cross-chain lending in our platform. Please join the the Trava team and members of the community look forward to helping you understand and use Trava. Why should we trust Trava?: Trava Protocol has been audited and secured internally, by third parties (Hacken, Certik) and even Community Checks. Check https://docs.trava.finance/security/ for more information. How to interconnect with Trava protocol?: In order to interconnect with Trava protocol, you need to deposit your asset into lending pools. After depositing, you will earn passive income, this income is based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, you can also borrow by using your deposited assets as collateral. Do I need to pay fees to interconnect with Trava protocol?: Interacting with the protocol requires transactions and so transaction fees for BSC Blockchain usage, which depend on the network status and transaction complexity. Where are my deposited tokens stored?: After depositing, your deposit funds are stored in a smart contract. The code of the smart contract is public, open-source, formally verified, and audited by third-party auditors. You can withdraw your funds from the pool back to your wallet.",

To ensure the safe, we have several strategies as follows: * Auditing code performed by third parties: we have been audited by Hacken and Certik. We are contacting others. * Audit internally our code. We have a strong team with high-security skills. * Community check: we will organize hackathon events and reward programs that encourage the community to detect risks. What are the TRAVA token and its utility?: We issue TRAVA tokens based on Binance smart chain's BEP-20 standard; the total supply is 5 billion.

    "text": "Is Borrowing assets more beneficial than Selling?: If you sell your assets, you will lose the possession of this particular asset. It means you would be no longer entitled to the potential upside value gain. Whereas, by borrowing, you can still obtain these potential earnings (working capital) without losing your asset. You can borrow when unexpected expenses happen and leverage your holding assets for other investment opportunities. How to borrow?: In order to borrow, you need to deposit any asset to be used as collateral first (check out the Depositing & Earning FAQ section for more info). After depositing, you simply go to the ‚ÄúBorrow‚Äù section and click the ‚ÄúBorrow‚Äù button on the asset you want to borrow. Input the amount and approve the transaction. The borrowed amount is based on the available deposits that you used as collateral. What is the maximum amount can I borrow?: The maximum amount you can borrow depends on your deposited value and the available liquidity. Please notice the health factor and liquidation threshold indicators to guarantee your collaterals are in the state of safety. Besides, you can not borrow if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor is too low. What type of asset do I repay my loans?: When repaying a loan, the type of asset that you need to repay is in the same asset you borrowed. For example, if you borrow 1 BNB you will pay back 1 BNB plus interest accrued. Another way to pay back the loan is using your collateral. If you want to pay back the loan based on USD price you can borrow any of the available stable coins as USDC, DAI, USDT, etc.",

    "text": "How much interest would I pay for my loans?: When borrowing, the interest rate you need to pay depends on the borrowing rate which is determined from the supply and demand ratio of the asset. Moreover, the interest rate is a variable rate so that it changes constantly. The current borrowing rate of your borrowed assets is shown in the Borrowing section of your dashboard, you can check it any time. What is Health factor?: Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation?: The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals. When do I need to repay the loan?: As long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan. However, the accrued interest of your borrowing will grow day by day, making your health factor decrease. When it reaches the threshold of liquidation, your deposited assets are more likely to fall into liquidation status.",

    "text": "Introduction: In borrowing, when a borrowers‚Äô health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value, a liquidation process might happen. In other words, borrowers‚Äô collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty?: The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated?: In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2.

What is users‚Äô credit score?: In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. What benefits does credit score brings to users?: -For borrowers, the primary benefit is that they can borrow with a \"preferential interest rate\" if their credit score is high. They can also receive higher loan-to-value-ratio compared to other users For lenders, who have high credit scores easily become LPs of different pools. Moreover, when they create a pool, their pool will have a higher credit score because the pool creator's credit score is also a criterion for the pool scoring. Especially, pool owners can rate borrowers‚Äô credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt.",

    "text": "How Credit scores for wallet addresses are calculated?: To evaluate credit scores for wallet addresses, TRAVA credit scoring model will take into account 5 factors: 1. Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address. 2. Transaction history: TRAVA aggregates all transactions of a wallet address across all platforms to calculate various parameters such as (i) transaction amount, (ii) number of liquidations, etc. 3. Loans ratio: represents the debt position of an account, including the Loan-to-balance ratio and Loan-to-investment ratio. 4. Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. 5. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range. The z-score is calculated from the mean and the standard deviation from every corresponding parameter of all accounts. To be more specific, you can read this function in TRAVA whitepaper. How the user's credit score will be updated?: Our system has both periodic updates and instant updates. The instant update occurs when users actively make transactions such as deposit, withdraw, repay... Or when users view their credit score on our app. In case a user has not viewed their credit score and had no transactions for a long time, their credit score is still updated periodically and automatically, which can be weekly or monthly. We are still trying to optimize it. Which objects does Trava evaluate credit score for?: At the moment, Trava has been evaluating the credit scores for 3 types of Objects: Wallet addresses (users), tokens, and NFTs.",

    "text": "How to increase my credit score?: To improve the credit score of your wallet, you would need to take into account our five parameters, i.e., Total asset, Transaction history, Loans ratios, Circulating assets, and Trustworthiness of possessing assets. For instance, you should increase your wallet balance with prestige coins and tokens, perform more transactions and become more active in the crypto market, maintaining good Loan-to-balance and Loan-to-investment ratios, supply more liquidity to lending pools, trade on lending DApps to earn as much profit as you can, avoid collateral liquidation while borrowing, and possess at least $1000 valuable token (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, or BNB). Besides, you need to be credible users for a long time. It is because to avoid fraud, TRAVA calculates some credit score parameters based on their average values in the last k days, where k depends on the volatility of the crypto market. Moreover, some parameters are assessed based on the ‚Äústandardized score‚Äù function, which calculates the mean and the standard deviation of all accounts‚Äô parameters. Thus, trying to be the best at some criteria would improve your credit score too. Why did my credit score decrease?: The reasons why your credit score drops might be: You have bad transactions such as borrowing liquidations, your balance decrease, your borrowing rate is higher, you are not active enough, etc...You can read our white paper to understand how the credit score mechanism functions. https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/credit-score-evaluation PreviousTroubleshootingNextNFTs Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?",

    "text": "Does Trava apply NFTs in the ecosystem?: Yes, TRAVA allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract. How does Trava price NFTs?: Trava will provide the auction function for NFT assets. Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way. We also avoid the price fluctuation of NFT because the NFTs have been priced in the auction contract before. What can I do with NFTs after the auction?: TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT. Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back. PreviousTrava Credit ScoreNextListing Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?",

Some feasible solutions recommended by Certik that would also mitigate the potential risk include: * Time-lock with reasonable latency, i.e. 48 hours, for awareness on privileged operations; * Assignment of privileged roles to multi-signature wallets to prevent a single point of failure due to the private key; * Introduction of a DAO/governance/voting module to increase transparency and user involvement.",

TRAVA FINANCE also brings to you the credit score function based on financial data on-chain analysis, which is a useful tool to reduce risk and increase profits for all users. We have started integrating AI technology to our products with the ultimate goal of giving users the best experience on Web3 and with DeFi space. We build our solutions on TRAVA.FINANCE whose smart contracts are deployed on the BSC network, so the speed of transactions, gas fees, and robustness depend on the BSC network. However, in the near future, we will allow cross-chain lending on our platform. With the purpose to help users to understand the fundamentals of Trava Protocol, this Portal links to key resources on Trava. Please join our Channel to discuss with Trava community on , our team and community members are always willing to help you to build on top of Trava. FAQ: Summary of Frequently Asked Questions about Trava Introduction and its key features. In this FAQ, we provide users with answers of that concerns in a catchy and brief manner. Community Telegram: We would like to invite you to join the Trava community where all issues about Trava will be discussed and solved. Whitepaper: The white paper is a report to briefly inform users about Trava protocol, complex issues, and Trava features. Please visit our white paper https://docs.trava.finance/ to have an overview of Trava.Finance. Risk Management: The Risk Management analyses the fundamental risks of Trava protocol and presents methods we implement to reduce them. Security: To ensure the safe, we have several strategies and we are in the process of them: (1)Audit internally our code by a high-skill team, (2) Audit code performed by third parties, our code now is audited by Certik and Hacken, (3) Community Check through Hackathon/Bounty programs.

As being the world‚Äôs first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending, Trava has been forming adequate standards to manage the risks emerging from the hyper-connected ecosystem. The following documentation illustrates the protocol parameters for the purpose of alleviating the fundamental risks that may arise. These are the parameters defined when creating the Pool such as borrowing/lending interest rate, liquidity threshold, Loan to Value ratio, Health Factor, Liquidation penalty, and Reserve Factor. These parameters are of paramount importance to users when participating in Pool operations. Pool parameters are divided into two groups: interest rate parameters and risk parameters.

    "text": "The interest rate strategy of Trava pool is designed to control liquidity risk while also maximizing utilization. The Utilisation Rate determines the borrow interest rates.: Each token in each Pool has a utilization rate at each time , which is defined by the ratio =/U_t = L_t/A_twhere represents total borrows and represents total liquidity. This ratio regulates how much of a deposited token is used in the market. When this ratio approaches 100%, there will be a scarcity of tokens in the Pool. The borrower will be unable to borrow at this time, and the lender will be unable to withdraw funds from the Pool. To avoid this, interest rate and risk parameters must be calculated in precise detail for each token.",

    "text": "Interest Rate Model: Interest Rate Model tends to be a cost-effective way for the Pool to run itself. The parameters of the pool will aid in the adjustment of borrow and deposit rates to a balanced and reasonable point. In practice, numerous models are used: linear rate, non-linear rate, and kinked rate. The kinked rate model is used in the Trava protocol. As with the non-linear model, such models have the virtue of significantly shifting the incentives for borrowers and lenders beyond some usage level. In contrast to non-linear models without a kink, they also introduce a point of abrupt change in the interest rate, beyond which interest rates begin to sharply rise. The kinked model is based on several parameters and is described as follows. Firstly, the ratio optimal utilization rate UoptimalU_\\text{optimal}Uoptimal‚Äã is a parameter that determines the best-fit utilization rate for the protocol. It varies from token to token and depends on the risk and volatility of the token. For example, it could be 80% for stable tokens like DAI, or just 65% for unstable coins like LINK. Next, the interest rate is a function that varies based on utilization rate. Three parameters are used to define this function: (1) Initial rate , (2) the constant Rslope1R_\\text{slope1}Rslope1‚Äã is used when UoptimalU_t < U_\\text{optimal}Uoptimal‚Äã, and (3) the constant Rslope2R_\\text{slope2}Rslope2‚Äã is used when ‚â•UoptimalU_t \\geq U_\\text{optimal}Uoptimal‚Äã. Specifically, the interest rate is defined by: * If UoptimalU_t <U_\\text{optimal}Uoptimal‚Äã then =+Uoptimal√óRslope1R_t = R_0 + \\frac{U_t}{U_\\text{optimal}} \\times R_\\text{slope1}Uoptimal‚Äã‚Äã√óRslope1‚Äã * If ‚â•UoptimalU_t \\geq U_\\text{optimal}Uoptimal‚Äã then =+Rslope1+‚àíUoptimal1‚àíUoptimal√óRslope2R_t= R_0 + R_\\text{slope1} + \\frac{ U_t - U_\\text{optimal}}{1 -U_\\text{optimal}} \\times R_\\text{slope2}Rslope1‚Äã+1‚àíUoptimal‚Äã‚àíUoptimal‚Äã‚Äã√óRslope2‚Äã The interest rates have a kink in them: they sharply change at a certain point. A variety of protocols use interest rates like this, including Aave and Compound. As users mint, redeem, borrow, repay, or liquidate tokens, the interest rate changes with the utilization rate . As a result, it's also known as a variable interest rate.",

That is, borrowers will be charged interest that changes every second. He must pay more interest if the Utilisation Rate is higher, and vice versa. Mathematically, at each time t, the Borrow rate (per second) is =/YB_t = R_t/Y where Y=31536000Y= 3153600031536000 is the number of seconds in a year. If the user is currently borrowing tokens then the interest payable is √óT_t \\times B_t . The interest payable is accrued to the loan in the next second, that is T=(1+)T_{t+1}=T_t(1+B_t) . Deposit rate: Deposit rate and Borrow rate are closely linked. Precisely, at each time , deposit rate is determined based on Utilization Rate and borrow rate and reserve factor . Precisely, deposit rate is defined by =√ó√ó(1‚àír)D_t = U_t \\times B_t\\times (1-r). In terms of probability, is probability that each token is borrowed, thus is the average value of interest earned from each token deposited into the Pool. For deposit, the calculation of interest is updated after each operation deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay. In particular, if a user is currently depositing tokens, after a period of time \\Delta{t} (in seconds) he will receive an interest of √ó√óŒît,T_t \\times D_t \\times \\Delta{t}, and this interest is accrued to the deposited token, i.e. after time \\Delta{t} he have Tt+Œît=√ó(1+√óŒît).T_{t+\\Delta{t}} = T_t \\times (1 + D_t \\times \\Delta{t}).= PreviousIntroductionNextRisk parameters Last updated 3 years ago Was this helpful?",

For example, if the LTV is 75%, borrowers will be allowed to borrow 0.75 ETH worth of corresponding currency for every 1 ETH worth of collateral. For a wallet, the maximum LTV is calculated as the weighted average of LTVs of collateral assets and their value.

For example, a Liquidation threshold of 80% means that if the value rises above 80% of the collateral, the position is undercollateralised and could be liquidated. The difference between the Loan To Value and the Liquidation Threshold is a safety cushion for borrowers.

    "text": "Trava Mini-Game Series: Published in 3 min readAug 25, 2022 Share Introduction To Fortune Mining To provide users with more services in the Trava Ecosystem, we have planned to implement the Trava minigame series. After the Trava Lottery and Battlehand, the next game ‚Äî Fortune Mining, will be soon published on September 8th 2022. Introduction to fortune mining What is Fortune Mining? As mentioned, this is an important component of the Trava Minigame Series. The game is built on the well-known blockchain idea of the No-loss-rewards game, allowing participants to earn big prizes without worrying about losing their money. How does it work? So how exactly does Fortune Mining work? For more details, users first need to deposit their money into the Fortune Mining Pool. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm). That means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones. The benefit Fortune Mining brings to players. _No loss to worry about_: As the old saying goes, ‚ÄúMore risk brings higher return.‚Äù However, with Fortune Mining, players will not need to worry about their losses. Because of the unique mechanism, there will be no loss, and unlucky players can get their deposits back after a certain period.",

    "text": "_Big prize to look for_: While there is no loss to be concerned about, the winner may earn significantly more benefits than they would if they had deposited into the regular pool. For example , assuming that we run a Fortune Mining pool for users to deposit DAI and gain 20.000 DAI in total deposited after one week. With APY at 1.5% (that is converted to APR at about 0,92%) and APR at 4.08%, respectively, two weeks later, the total reward for the winner will be calculated as: _20000 (0.92%+ 4.08%)/365 14 = 38.356 DAI._ That means if you deposit 100 DAI at first and become the lucky one, you will receive about $38,356 (the interest rate at about 1000%) instead of $0,19 (the interest rate at about 5%). As in the example above, the gap between the rewards you could get in a normal pool and the Fortune Mining pool is very significant. For that reason, this mini-game will be a good choice for those with small capital to try their luck and get much more money than usual. To sum up, what do you need to do to attain the benefits? Step 1. Deposit your token into the Fortune Mining Pool Step 2. Waiting for a certain period (depending on each campaign) Step 3 . Check the result: * If you are the lucky one: Congratulations, you get all the rewards from the pool * If you have not been lucky yet, don‚Äôt worry, you can withdraw your deposit or keep them in the pool, then try your luck in the next period. Notes: We will soon run a voting snapshot for our community to decide which asset should be put in the Fortune Mining pool. Stay tuned for that.

You can find out more about our team on our website: https://trava.finance/ Our vision and mission: NFT-collateralization is considered as one of our USPs. As a result, Trava Finance is making progress toward its goal of allowing NFTs to be used as collateral and improving the lending protocol. In the future, we will develop the auction mechanism to price our NFTs and then prepare to integrate NFTs into our lending pool, which acts as collateral for loans. Trava NFT Marketplace, which is planned to launch first, will be the first step on our path to enable NFT-collateralization feature and bring huge benefits to our lenders and borrowers in the near future. The launch of Trava Knight NFT also helps us to increase TRAVA utility in our system, as all the trading on our Marketplace will be in $TRAVA. Thus, $TRAVA holders will receive a lot of benefits from the launch of Trava Knight NFT. Moreover, our mission is also to maximize the utility of Trava Knight NFT in our lending pool system.

Then, the terrible Dragons of the North came. Led by the Elder Wyrms, they rent lands with their teeth and claws, burn cities with their fiery breath and ravage the forests with their wings. Wherever the Dragons went, death followed suit. Fear and panic spreaded throughout Trava Kingdom, and the land once overflowing with life now barren, wasted and desolated. Before long, the Dragons had scourged all cities and villages of Trava Kingdom but the Sacred Citadel, Middangeard, where lay the Lending Pool, the lifesource of Trava Kingdom itself. The brief respite afforded the Kingdom was but fleeting, and the final days drew nigh‚Ä¶ In the darkest hours, King Svitanae walked to the Lending Pool, with the Holy Scepter tight in hand. ‚ÄúI summon thee, Goddess of the Pool. Heed my word, and deliver us from inevitable doom. Come, Viviane!‚Äù. A vague silhouette appeared, radiating a bright aura that shone upon the castle not unlike midsummer noon. The Goddess Viviane appeared, bringing along her solemn voice: ‚ÄúThe Champion hath been reincarnated, and he shall be the one who endeth the Dragons‚Äô reign.‚Äù At the same moment, an enigmatic voice echoed throughout the Kingdom. ‚ÄúLegends of the Land, heed thine King‚Äôs call. Gather thyself at the Citadel, and thou shall be blessed by my power.‚Äù Men of all ages gathered at Middangeard, and without exception, each was granted a Trava Knight Armor set, blessed by Viviane power through the Lending Pool. The new Order of the Holy Knight of Trava was thus formed, and the hundred-year Draconic War thus began. Until the prophetic Champion of the Crystal would arrive‚Ä¶",

    "text": "The Epic of Trava Knights - Chapter II: The Burning Flame of Daedalus The night was dark and cold, and snow was falling down, whitening the shoulder of a robed figure, walking slowly but firmly towards a glimmering light in the distance. The howling winds and blistering frost did not seem to deter this figure‚Äôs presence, even though his robe tattered, his boots torn, and each gust seemed to cut deeper and deeper into his flesh and bones. Even in the blackest of the night, there were always two amber dots, shining ever brightly, gazing ever heavensward as they had done for so long. For this robed figure was King Svitanae, and for him bearing the weight of his Kingdom on his back. ‚ÄúKnock, knock!‚Äù. King Svitanae arrived at a wooden hut, located high on Orange Mountain, the source of the aforementioned flickering light. ‚ÄúWho disturbeth me?‚Äù - a voice as hollow as a winter eventide, echoed through the darkness. ‚ÄúIt is me, King Svitanae, and I am here to collect thy debt.‚Äù The door burst open, an old man with a crooked back and wrinkled skin thus appeared. ‚ÄúThou hath come.‚Äù ‚ÄúDaedalus, the greatest blacksmith in the land, I request thee aid. The dragons cometh, and ordinary weaponry do naught against their magic.‚Äù ‚Äú... I care not for the fate of this accursed land. But it is thou whomst I owe‚Ä¶ Surpass me in combat, and I would consider thy requisition.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo be it.‚Äù Moments later, two shadows emerged, stancing in opposition on a grassy arena. Daedalus, once a crooked-back man, then standing straight. His head held high, his azure eyes shone bright, his grip on Damocles, the legendary sword, firm and tight, his grey hair blowing against the wind, creating mesmerizing silver lines. In the moment, he was not an old geezer anymore, he was a warrior, the bloodline of Mars ran through his vein, burning ever fiery and fiercely. Svitanae, breathing slowly and calmly, gazed towards Daedalus. His grip trembled slightly, not from fear, not from intimidation, but from determination, from the responsibilities entrusted to him by millions of his subjects. As if understanding its master‚Äôs resolve, Laevateinn slightly shook, creating a humming sound pierced through the darkness. ‚ÄúWe finish this in one strike.‚Äù A flash of light. A sound of crossing blades. A circular shockwave, originating from the dead center of the arena, roared through the night. Snow instantly vaporized, raining down not unlike midsummer storms. Dust slowly settled, revealing two shadows, each holding his sword straight from his arm. As if time had stood still. A long time afterwards, a shadow suddenly collapsed to the ground. ‚ÄúThou‚Ä¶ hath bested me‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is for my Kingdom. I can not‚Ä¶ No, I must not fail my people.‚Äù ‚ÄúVery well. I shall fulfill my debt‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòTwas my destiny, and I shall accept it.‚Äù Daedalus, having regained his old man form, stood up and walked back to his hut. Inside, he lit up a long forgotten furnace. The flame of Daedalus, not red, but deep blue like the boundless sky, danced happily inside the furnace, as if welcoming a long lost father home. ‚ÄúBring me materials, I shall forge thee equipment. Consider my debt paid in full.\" The hundred-year Draconic War thus continued‚Ä¶",

Anyone wants to contest this lovely lady?‚Äù ‚ÄúSOLD!‚Äù As the night passes, sounds of elites and aristocrats, carefree of the tragedy looming by the dragons, echoed through the vast halls of the Auction House, a mansion owned by Winfred Haytere, the wealthiest man of Trava Kingdom. In contrary to the brave knights who put their lives on the line for the existence of Trava Kingdom, a huge portion of aristocrats could not care less about the survival of the common folks, and they indulged in endless parties, bought the most luxurious decorations they could afford, and the Auction Night, held semiannually at the Auction House, exclusive to nobles, surely was of an important event for the elites to show off their wealth. The Auction this year was no different, until suddenly‚Ä¶ the lights went all off, and a sound of bell echoed through the dreaded silence of the halls. ‚ÄúThere is no need to panic. I just came to retrieve what is rightfully mine.‚Äù - a dull voice emanated from a ghastly shadow, hanging on the beam of the Auction House. ‚ÄúWho art thou? Guards! Seize this man!‚Äù - screamed Winfred, as he desperately tried to stop his shaking legs. The guards were quick to enter the main hall, and began firing crossbows relentlessly at the shadowy figure, but all of the arrows passed through the figure effortlessly, as if the figure was nothing but dark mists. An eerie laughter suddenly bursted, windows opened and a strange wind blew through the hall, extinguished the torches of the guards, and seemingly their energy too, as one by one they collapsed to the ground, like young trees before raging storms. ‚ÄúThey are just sleeping.‚Äù - said the shadow, while slightly turning its head and glancing at Winfred. In others‚Äô eyes, the shadow was but unchanging, but in Winfred‚Äôs, the shadow was a fiery phantom, a demon hailed from hell, with crimson blood eyes gazing into his very soul. ‚ÄúThe dragons cometh soon. Trava Knights needeth these armors more than these worthless nobles. Let them join the auctions!‚Äù ‚ÄúY‚Ä¶ Y‚Ä¶ Yes‚Ä¶ Anything thou want.‚Äù ‚ÄúVery well. Then I shall be leaving. I expect thy cooperation.‚Äù The lights were turned on again, and after the rambles died down, people noticed the Crystal Armor of Sir Cedric was gone, disappeared from the podium. The Phantasm of the Auction House was thus born, as well as fancy tales and amusing ballads, fantasizing him as a noble thief, or merely an exceptional swindler. From afar, on the hill looking down to the Auction House, stood still a shrouded figure, holding a Crystal Armor in its arm. ‚ÄúFather‚Ä¶ I shall don your armor, to protect my sister‚Ä¶no, to protect your beloved Trava Kingdom from the shadow‚Ä¶‚Äù.",

The Dragons marched on, and had claimed half of the Northern Realms. The situation is dire. To make matters worse, another terrible abomination appeared, as the dragons called it, the Dilution! Everywhere it went, lands were drained of aether, trees died, animals fled, and humans had nothing more than dirt to survive on. An emergency board had been held, where all of the Knights of the Trava Kingdom gathered and discussed the next actions. As the Dilution drew ever closer and grew ever larger with each inch advanced, Sir Kuana recommended taking immediate action and intercept the Dilution at once, meanwhile Dame Johanna argued that they would need a careful approach and would have to take care of other frontiers first. The hour went on, the Knights reached a consensus of what to do. They would split up, each would take care of a front, and those who were more experienced would take the Dilution head on, vowing to stop it at all cost.

Note that with each wallet, the maximum number of Trava Knight NFT that can be deposited in one vault is one Knight NFT.

With Copper, Silver and Gold Vault, if NFT owners withdraw their NFTs within 7 days, the farming rewards will decrease by 10%. Knights with a higher rarity can be deposited in vaults of a lower rarity. Continuing the example above, one of your Gold Knights can be deposited in Gold vault and the other can be deposited in either Copper vault or Silver vault and earn APR corresponding to those vaults. Furthermore, for Knight NFTs put in Farming vaults, we shall use the \"Polish Mechanism‚Äù. After depositing Knight NFTs in those vaults, users must check their Knights on a regular basis through the Farming site, which is considered a polishing action.

    "text": ": Formula to calculate Farming rewards How to calculate the rewards for Copper, Silver and Gold Vaults? Each vault has a value called emissionPerSecond . This is a fixed amount that all depositors will be rewarded when they deposit NFT per second. Therefore, the fewer number of people staking NFT, the more rewards each staker will get. How to calculate the rewards for Diamond and Crystal Vaults? The Glossiness of each NFT starts off at 100%, but it gradually decreases over time, affecting the incentives received when users deposit their NFTs in the vault. Users must complete \"Polishing\" acts in order to receive 100% of the rewards. The amount of reward from NFT polishing shall be calculated using 2 parameters: decayRate and decayInterval . Concretely, after a decayInterval (a certain amount of time), if the NFT is not polished, the rewards for the next decayInterval will be reduced ( decayRate , calculated in % will decrease) For example: decayInterval = 2 days and decayRate = 10% indicates that: every two days without polishing, the rewards of the next day will be reduced (due to the NFT glossiness). Hence, after 20 days, the amount of rewards for NFT will be 0. If you stake NFT for a period t = 9, the amount of incentives that you probably get is 450 Trava (On average per day you will get 450/9 = 50). However, you have forgotten to polish for 9 days. Then, the amount of rewards you receive is only 370 Trava. The amount of incentive you get is described as below: Minus Rewards 10% 10% 20% 20% 30% 30% 40% Remaining Rewards(TRAVA) The detailed calculation us as follows: (X is the rewards NFT depositor will receive after t days) The average rewards each day NFT staker will receive: m=m = \\frac{X}{t} Number of decayInterval that depositor have to go through: n=tdecayIntervaln = \\frac{t}{decayInterval}decayInterval‚Äã The result of this calculation will be rounded down. * If n < , the rewards depositor will receive is: m t = X * If n 1decayInterval\\frac{1}{decayInterval}decayInterval‚Äã The percentage of minus rewards you get at the end of decayInterval period: p=(n‚àí1)‚àódecayRatep = ( n - 1) decayRatedecayRate The total amount of incentives you will receive: m‚àó[(2‚àíp)‚àón‚àódecayInterval2+(t‚àín‚àódacayInterval)‚àó(1‚àíp‚àídecayRate)]m [ (2 - p ) * n * \\frac{decayInterval}{2} + (t - n * dacayInterval) * (1 - p - decayRate) ]decayInterval‚Äã+dacayInterval)‚àódecayRate)] * If 1decayRate\\frac{1}{decayRate} decayRate‚Äã< n: The total amount of rewards you get: m‚àó(1decayRate+1)‚àódecayInterval2m * (\\frac{1}{decayRate} + 1 )* \\frac{decayInterval} {2} (decayRate‚Äã+decayInterval‚Äã In the above example, we have X = 450, t = 9 We can calculate: m = 50, n = 4, p= 0.3 Put into the formula, we get: 50‚àó[(2‚àí0.3)‚àó4‚àó+(9‚àí4‚àó2)‚àó(1‚àí0.3‚àí0.1)]=37050 * [(2 - 0.3) * 4 * \\frac{2}{2} + (9 - 4 * 2) * (1 -0.3 -0.1) ] = 3700.3)‚àó0.1)]=",

In the new Farming mechanism, we provide 5 more vaults for Heuristic Farming, and you can deposit as many knights as you want into each Vault, provided that those knights have the same rarity as that Vault.

    "text": "The Trade-Up Mechanism allows NFT owners to combine multiple identical Armoury NFTs of the same rarity and the same type into a single higher rarity Armoury NFT of the same type. For example, multiple Silver Helmets can be traded up to a Gold Helmet. The idea of Trade-Up Mechanism is that NFT owners will be given a great opportunity to take advantage of their unused NFTs and then level up them to the higher rarity. With higher rarity, NFT owners can assemble items into Knight NFTs of higher rarity and farm them for a higher APR, allowing them to gain bigger profits. Moreover, the high rarity of the NFT will bring its owner a huge advantage in Auction mechanism in the future. In the meantime, our Trade-up Mechanism will help us solve the problem of redundancy of idle NFTs as we issue more chests. 4 Armoury NFTs of the same rarity and type will be assembled into a single NFT of higher rarity and the same type. The success rate of trading up will be based on a base rate, and increase with EXP. * Success: A new NFT with higher rarity will be minted and transferred to the wallet of the user. In the meantime, four ingredient Armoury NFTs will be burnt. Furthermore, regardless of how much EXP the four burned NFTs had gained, the EXP of the new NFT will be 0. * Failure: Users will only receive back three out of four ingredient NFTs, with the lowest EXP NFT being burned. In our Trade-up Mechanism, each rarity has a failure rate called _baseFailureRate_ and a failure time threshold called _timeBase_. Moreover, the failure rate will be determined by the total EXP of all Armoury NFTs which are selected to do trade-up, this EXP is referred to as _collectiveEXP_. The EXP of selected Armoury NFTs is inversely proportional to the failure rate, which means that the higher the total EXP of selected NFTs, the lower the failure rate. If all 4 NFT pieces don't have any experience point, the failure rate is equal to the base failure rate. **Trade-up** **Copper ‚Üí Silver** **Silver ‚Üí Gold** **Gold ‚Üí Diamond** **Diamond ‚Üí Crystal** **Failure Rate** 50% 60% 70% 80% **Time Base** 8 days 20 days 64 days 200 days collectiveEXP=exp(nft1)+exp(nft2)+exp(nft3)+exp(nft4) collectiveEXP = exp(nft1) + exp(nft2) + exp(nft3) + exp(nft4)collectiveEXP=exp(nft1)+exp(nft2)+exp(nft3)+exp(nft4) The formula for failure rate will be calculated as belows: Where, * _RFP: Relative Fail Percent_ * _b: Base Failure Rate_ * _x: Collective Experience of Ingredients_ * _t: Time Base of Rarity_ _If x = 0 then RFP = b_ _If x < t then RFP = b * k, k > 50%_ _If x = t then RFP = b * 0.5_ _If x > t then RFP = b * k, k < 50%_ For example: All 4 NFTs are Diamond Weapons and have different EXP, respectively: * NFT 1: 1000000 EXP * NFT 2: 2000000 EXP * NFT 3: 3500000 EXP * NFT 4: 2500000 EXP => x = 1000000 + 2000000 + 1500000 + 500000 = 9000000 EXP t = 200*24*60*60 = 17280000 Therefore, the failure rate of Trade-Up will decrease to 52.74%, meaning you will have a 47.26% chance of successfully trading up if your collective experience of your ingredient NFTs are like above. Note that, due to the nature of the blockchain development language, the displayed result may vary very slightly around the exact computed value. If you are in the failure rate, your NFT 1 with 1000000 EXP (the lowest EXP) will be burned and you will only receive the rest of your ingredient NFTs (NFT2, NFT3 and NFT4).

    "text": "We are happy to announce that the Trade-Up V2 will be launched sooner than you expected to give Trava Knights the opportunity to make use of their NFTs V1 and participate in Dilution Staking.: Trade-up mechanism: Prepare for the War of the Web3 This is the preparation for the next phase of Trava Finance, as only the Knights V2 can participate in Dilution Staking (except Limited Knights). So, for members who still have NFTs V1 and don‚Äôt know what to do with them, this V Trade-up Mechanism will help you to stay in the ‚Äúbattle.‚Äù Introduction: The Trade-Up Mechanism allows NFT owners to combine multiple identical Armoury NFTs V1 of the same rarity into an Armoury NFT V2. For example, multiple Silver Helmets V1 can be traded up to a Silver Helmet V2. The Trade-Up Mechanism aims to provide Trava Armoury NFT owners with a valuable opportunity to utilize their unused NFTs V1 for greater profits. By combining Armoury V2 items, users can create Knight NFTs V2 and join in the upcoming Dilution Staking feature. How does the Trade-up work?: Each rarity will have a different Trade-up formula. The rarer the Armory items, the higher the Trade-up rate. Trade-up for NFTs V2 3 (three) Copper V1 Armoury items can be exchanged for 1 Copper V2 Armoury item. 3 (three) Silver V1 Armoury items = 1 Silver V2 Armoury item. 2 (two) Gold V1 Armoury items = 1 Gold V2 Armoury item. 2 (two) Diamond V1 Armoury items = 1 Diamond V2 Armoury item. 1 (one) Crystal V1 Armoury items = 1 Crystal V2 Armoury item. Summary: Unlike the previously launched Trade-up Mechanism to upgrade the rarity of Armory items, this Trade-up Mechanism will change your NFTs V1 to V2. Besides, you won‚Äôt have to worry about failure rate like when upgrading NFT items while performing this act. Remember that Trade-up Mechanism is only for Armory items, not Knight NFTs. So you should dismantle them to get items and then you can do the trade-up to V2. PreviousTrade-up MechanismNextTransmutation Last updated 1 year ago",

Notes: * After the Transmutation, the EXP of the new item will be calculated as the average of the two Trava armoury items transmuted. * A certain amount of time is required to do transmutation. * Those transmuting their items need to pay a small fee in $TRAVA, which depends on the rarity of each item. * Unlike the trade-up mechanism, in Transmutation, there is no failure rate which means users can always transmute their items successfully. Check the detailed information about transmutation time and fee in the following table: **Rarity** **Copper** **Silver** **Gold** **Diamond** **Crystal** **Forgery time** 2 hours 4 hours 8 hours 16 hours 32 hours 200 500 1250 3500 25000 Where, * Forgery time: The period it takes to transmute the armoury item. * Fee: An transmutation fee of Trava Knights need to pay For example, you transmute one diamond Shield with 100,000 EXP and one diamond Shield with 50,000 EXP to get a diamond Weapon.

    "text": "At the moment, EXP (Experience Point) is the point that shows how long an Armoury NFT is staked in our vaults. EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault. Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault We‚Äôve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items). You can see your EXP either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace. Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs. However, when you withdraw your Knight NFT, disassemble and reassemble with different items to get another Knight NFT, your Armoury NFTs will have different EXPs. For example: You open 4 chests and get: Helmet, Shield, Armour and Weapon. You assemble them into a Knight NFT and farm in our vault. After 24h, the EXPs for Armoury NFTs are as follow: * Weapon EXP: 86400 * Shield EXP: 86400 * Armor EXP: 86400 * Helmet EXP: 86400 So EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400(86400 + 86400 + 86400 + 86400) / 4 = 86400(86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400 After 24h, you withdraw your Knight NFT to reassemble with Armoury NFTs you buy on Trava NFT Marketplace. Suppose, those Armoury NFTs you bought have been already farmed in vault before and have the EXPs as follow: * Weapon EXP: 86400 * Shield EXP: 100000 * Armor EXP: 320000 * Helmet EXP: 210000 Thus, the EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100(86400 + 100000 + 320000 + 210000) / 4 = 179100(86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100 There will be a lot of benefits for NFT owners to have high EXPs. The more EXP you have, the more value the NFT will be. This can help you to distinguish NFT value from other NFTs of the same type and rarity. Moreover, the EXP will be applied in our Trade-up Mechanism which will be launched soon. In the future, EXP will be used with Credit Score and applied to NFT-collateralization. It can be said that EXP is an important factor in Trava Knight NFT to reach our goal of collateralization. PreviousTransmutationNextExpedition Last updated 1 year ago",

    "text": "Stories of Mysterious Lands: Ruins of Alzatecia The Ruins of Alzatecia is located far to the west of the Trava Kingdom, in the middle of the Nymeria desert. Once a prosperous city, all that is left now are some stone columns and stone statues, portraying long forgotten kings - or gods. It is still unknown why Alzatecia was destroyed, but historians have agreed that the city‚Äôs position between the rocky pillars made it invulnerable to invasions. Upon further inspection of skeletons, traces of a deadly bacteria were found, and historians concluded that the city was most probably wiped by a plague. Nevertheless, adventurers still venture to these ruins, trying to find lost artifacts to collect or to sell on the black market. But, the land is desolated and infested with desert monsters - huge sandworms, giant vultures and deadly spiders - and the duty of keeping the place safe for travel falls on the noble Trava Knights. Peaks of Orange Mountain Situated on the Northern border of the Kingdom, Orange Mountain range got its name from the spectacular sight on the Summer Solstice day, when at exactly 5 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, the sun glimmers through the Peak of Shattered Hope, and the whole mountain range is dyed in a mesmerizing orange. Aside from that specific moment, the mountain range is perpetually white, covered in thick, deep snow, with blizzards constantly brewing and subsiding. The sub-zero temperature renders this place mostly inaccessible for inhabiting, humans and beasts alike, but brave souls still seek thrills atop the mountain peaks, and when things go awry, it‚Äôs turn for the Trava Knight to the rescue. Mystic Forest of Mythra Mythra, the Mystic Forest, is located only a few hundred miles away from the Holy Citadel of Middengeard, and it is home of various mythical beasts that are only thought to exist in books. At night, Mythra emits an eerie and mysterious gold shine, said to be the lingering flame of unfortunate souls captured by the forest. True to its name, venturing into Mythra is never an easy task, when not only you can be assaulted by rogue monsters at any moment, but the layout of the forest also changes constantly, rendering most maps useless. Only the most veteran of Knights are capable of navigating the forest with the assist of a special compass, and only they are capable of subduing monstrous mythical beasts - either to rescue wandering folks, or to collect ingredients for the Kingdom. The Southern Empty Located on the southern basin of Trava Kingdom is a vast uninhabitable landmass, usually referred to as the Southern Empty. The landmass is composed of several natural - or alien - stone pillars, with mysterious carvings of undiscovered origins. Even more strange, the pillars have veins latched onto them, and one can clearly see purple substances flowing inside these veins into the pillars, then disperses into the air in the form of a thick purple mist. The composition of the purple mist has not yet been known, since any attempt to contain these mist ended in failure. But it is believed that the mist directly affects one‚Äôs mind, as upon entering the Southern Empty, most people feel an unexplainable dread and despair, and in extreme cases, some end their lives on the spot. Thus, only the most elite and most steel-hearted Knights are capable of exploring the Southern Empty, and their efforts have recovered important artifacts from long lost past. Duparrich Bay Only ten years ago, Duparrich Bay was the ‚ÄúJewel of the Ocean‚Äù, the most important harbor of the Trava Kingdom, where three-quarters of foreign exchange must pass through. Not only did it lie on the intercontinental trade route, it also had beautiful beaches which proved popular with local folks and foreign tourists alike. Then, on that fateful day, the Darkeye Pirates came. With manpower up to hundreds of thousands, led by the self-proclaimed Pirate King Darkbeard, they ransacked the harbor, then occupied Duparrich Bay and turned it into its lair, occasionally sending pirate ships to wreck havoc on the East Sea. Several attempts to thwart the evil have been made, but the Darkeye‚Äôs strength is monumental, not to mention The Pirate King himself, who commands powers far from that of a human. Thus, a trip into Duparrich Bay, whether for rescuing civilians or retrieving pirated goods, is not for the inexperienced Knights, and surely one must think twice before charging into the evil‚Äôs jaw.

To embark on a mission, each Knight will have to spend some expenditure, paid in $TRAVA, to cover the cost of adventuring. However, should he prevail, the reward paid by Trava Kingdom will be much more glamorous, depending on the arduousness of the mission.Finishing the mission, Knights will receive rewards and experience depending on the mission report. The success rate of the mission depends on the difficulty of the mission, the rarity of the Knights and their accumulated experience. Rarer knights with higher EXP are more likely to complete their mission excellently and earn their owners greater rewards. Knights‚Äô owners are advised to plan carefully to send their Knight into suitable lands to maximize their rewards. Accomplishing a mission will yield you rewards and experience points, and overperforming a mission will yield yet greater rewards. But do not be discouraged from the atrocity of the lands, young Trava Knights! Even if you fail a mission, a portion of your adventure expense will be reimbursed by the Trava Kingdom, and the amount of experience earned will be much greater - for failures are the stepping stones to great achievements. At any time, Knights can abandon their quest, but note that by doing so, you shall forfeit any kind of rewards or reimbursement, and earn zero experience. The Expedition does not limit the number of Knights or the rarities of such Knights, thus you can send any number of any Knights into any land of your choice.",

When the bidding countdown is less than 5 minutes left , every new bid will extend the countdown by 5 minutes ; Each bid price will be increased by at least 5% of the previous one. Once the countdown ends, the auction item will be obtained by the last/highest bidder; The most important rule: 2.5% of the price increase for each bid is distributed to the previous bidder, and the remaining 97.5% would be the income of the auction publisher if it‚Äôs the last bid or returned to the bidder when it‚Äôs outbid. With the rules, each bidder would either take the 5% share of the next bid or obtain the auction Knight with the price he/she offered. And the first bidder will additionally be free from distributing his/her own 5% to other people. Note: The percentage that the later bidder pays for the earlier bidder is the same as the percentage that the sellers need to pay for the platform. So, 2.5% is also the amount auction publishers pay to the marketplace, which means that after receiving 97.5% of the final bidding price as income, sellers need to pay 2.5% of the income to the NFT marketplace. Therefore, the final payment rate that the sellers receive is 95.06% of the final bid. This fee is utilized for marketing, operating, and functioning.

This meant that A was the one who could receive the rewards and had to pay the platform fees. The system will automatically calculate the fee amount based on the Knight ownership of the winner. The rewards that A received are: * If A does not own Knight: 0.5 + 0.5 - 7.5% 0.5 = 0.9625 BNB * If A has Normal Knights: 0.5 + 0.5 - 2.5% 0.5 = 0.9875 BNB * If A has Limited Knight: 0.5 + 0.5 - 0%*0.5 = 1 BNB PreviousTrava NFT AuctionNextTrava NFT Ticket Last updated 1 year ago",

    "text": "Introduction to Trava Ticket: What is Trava Ticket? A ticket in Trava Finance is an exchangeable asset that allows users to own additional perks or access to products in the Trava Ecosystem. There are three types of tickets: Counter Ticket, Presale Ticket, and Incentive Ticket. Each has different usages, as described more thoroughly in the next part. What is it used for? As defined above, the Trava tickets carry out two primary uses: to exchange and access the Trava Ecosystem. Specifically, users can buy or sell these tickets on Trava Counter or Ticket Marketplace (the details in the next part) to earn profits from trading activities. In addition, as its name ‚Äî ‚ÄúTicket‚Äù ‚Äî this asset will be needed to participate in various programs in the Trava Ecosystem, including Trava NFT (farming, buying chest, etc.), Trava Lending (governance, bridge, NFT collateralization) or TraDAO, which might be rebranded to Trava Capital (based on community decision). Trava Counter, Ticket Marketplace, and three types of Ticket _Trava Counter and Ticket Marketplace_: Trava Counter and Ticket Marketplace are two platforms for users to exchange tickets. While the former is for trading with the protocol, the latter is for selling or buying peer-to-peer. Another fundamental difference between these two is the price determination method. - On Trava Counter: The counter price increases/decreases depending on the ticket demand but will always be maintained at a minimum of $1. Besides buying tickets, users can also sell these assets to the protocol at 80% of the current counter price. In fact, users can benefit from buying tickets and selling them at a higher price. For example, assuming that users buy tickets at 1$, two weeks later, if the current counter price increases to $2 because of the increasing demand, they can earn profits by selling these tickets at 1,6$ (80% of $2) to the protocol. - On the marketplace: The price will be determined by the sellers and buyers themselves.",

With this innovative idea, we long to enrich the whole ecosystem. Given that Trava Finance has developed various features and products, utilities of Trava Ticket will be applied right after its launch. In the long term, more and more features will be released gradually to enhance users‚Äô experience. : Trava Ticket Utilities Ticket will be implemented in the main products of Trava Finance, including Trava Knight NFT, Trava Lending, Trava Capital, and also the MiniGame Series.

In the upcoming feature of Trava Knight NFT, the Treasure Map, Ticket will be utilized as an entrance ticket. Players must have a Ticket to enter the missions in Treasure Map. By joining Treasure Map, users can have the opportunity of earning more Tickets and other rewards. Moreover, Ticket will boost the success rate in the Expedition feature. When a user has a Ticket, their success rate after finishing a mission in Expedition is much higher. To enter Expedition, users have to pay a small entrance fee, but the rewards are very worthy, especially now with the enhancement of owning a Ticket. Lastly, the essential utility of Ticket is the capability of exchanging Ticket for Chest and receiving Armoury to build a full Trava Knight. With this utility, users will have chances to enter the Trava Kingdom without paying a large amount of money to buy Knights directly from the Marketplace. Furthermore, with the assembled Knights, users can join in Mission features in Trava Knight NFT, including Farming to gain rewards and EXP, joining Expedition and earn rewards, Incentive Tickets, EXP, etc. In the future, Tickets will be implemented in the PvP Tournament in Trava Knight NFT.

Another utility of Ticket in Trava Lending is that users can make use of the Ticket to withdraw rewards in Governance earlier. Moreover, users can use Ticket to exchange for multiple transactions in Bridge, which helps the transaction process faster and more conveniently. For more details, Ticket owners will have the right to increase the number of transactions in 1 day, the maximum amount of tokens in a transaction/day, and create multiple bridge transactions at the same time‚Ä¶ NFT-collateralized has always been the ultimate goal of Trava Finance. Ticket, an asset with a fixed price range, will become one of the primary collaterals in the Trava ecosystem that users can collateralize to borrow from the system. The Ticket also allows users to have access to Auction/Sell/Buy veTRAVA in the NFT Marketplace as an NFT. These two utilities confirm the crucial position of Ticket in the journey of Trava NFT-collateralized. Trava Capital: Besides Trava Knight NFT, Trava Lending, Ticket also has its own role in TraDAO as a supportive asset. As a result, investors of TraDAO will enjoy the APR increase while owning a Ticket. Play-to-earn in MiniGame Series: Tickets will act like rewards and entrances for Fortune Mining. The detailed mechanism will be released soon. Moreover, users can earn more Tickets (besides the winning bet) by joining the Battle Hand MiniGame. In the near future, more MiniGames will be launched with the integration of Ticket. Trade-to-earn: Besides the above, users can also sell Counter Tickets at Trava Counter at 80% of the current Counter price. Moreover, all Ticket types, including Counter Tickets, Presale Tickets, and Incentive Tickets, can be sold in the Ticket Marketplace at a price determined by sellers (peer-to-peer). With the potential ability of Ticket, right after release, the Ticket utilities will be implemented throughout the Trava ecosystem.

More specific, using tickets, you can: - Change time/balance lock in Trava Governance - Be allowed to implement multiple transactions in Trava Bridge - Borrow assets with Tickets as NFT-collateralized - Withdraw rewards in Governance earlier - Be able to put veTRAVA on the Auction/Sell/Buy program. Scenario 3. Applied in Trava Knight NFT: Take a look at the diagram that shows how you can apply for Tickets in the Trava Knight NFT programs. To be more specific, you can first buy tickets, then use them to exchange for chests. After opening your chests and getting armories, you can either exchange them on the NFT marketplace or continue collecting armories to assemble the Trava NFT Knight. Then, you have multiple options related to trading or to joining missions and minigames. The TRAVA and Incentive tickets you earn can be continuously used to get tickets, then repeatedly enjoy their utilities. And the circulation list goes on. To sum up, by owning tickets and optimizing them in various functions in the Trava Ecosystem, you can constantly get benefits thanks to the circular benefit model.

The unique feature of this mission is that even Limited Knight can join. Not only can Limited Knights join, but also they can have priority in the opportunity of getting more Tickets as rewards after finishing the Treasure Map mission. Moreover, as an entrance fee, Knights must have 1 Ticket of any kind to join the Treasure Map mission. But don't worry! The rewards that you receive are worth every cost. Note: Users also have to pay a very small amount as a transaction fee. In conclusion, there are two important things that users MUST HAVE to enter Treasure Map Mission: + 1 Knight (Copper, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Crystal, and Limited Knight) + 1 Ticket (Counter Ticket, Presale Ticket, and Incentive Ticket) NOTE: You can deploy as many Knights as you want in the mission at the same time. ONE Knight requires ONE Ticket to enter. A mission will last for 6 HOURS. * Rewards: After finishing the Treasure Map mission, Knight will receive Tickets and EXP as a reward. This is a way for users to gain many Tickets simultaneously at a small price. The maximum number of rewarded Tickets can be up to 6 Tickets/deployed Knight. As mentioned above, any kind of Knight can join the mission, but the rewards are not the same for every Knight. Higher rarity will have a higher percentage of getting more rewards.",
