How Credit scores for wallet addresses are calculated?,0,False,"['To evaluate credit scores for wallet addresses, TRAVA credit scoring model will take into account 5 factors: Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address. Transaction history: TRAVA aggregates all transactions of a wallet address across all platforms to calculate various parameters such as (i) transaction amount, (ii) number of liquidations, etc. Loans ratio: represents the debt position of an account, including the Loan-to-balance ratio and Loan-to-investment ratio. Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range. The z-score is calculated from the mean and the standard deviation from every corresponding parameter of all accounts. To be more specific, you can read this function in TRAVA whitepaper.   ', 'The credit score evaluation in TRAVA.FINANCE is primarily based on on-chain data. At present, we collect, enrich, and analyze Binance Smart Chain transactions, including the native transferring transactions and the transactions to deposit, withdraw, repay, and borrow tokens generated from Binance Smart Chain lending DApps. The credit rating of digital assets helps pool owners and liquid providers to minimize liquidity risk. TRAVA.FINANCE divides digital assets into two categories: Tokens/coins and other digital assets (e.g., NFT, smart contracts, stoke tokens) and evaluates their credit scores. The credit score of a Token is assessed based on 4 parameters, i.e., (i) the token price, (ii) the market cap (MC) of the token, (iii) the token trading volume, and (iv) the number of transactions related to the token. High-credit-score tokens have a great advantage over low-credit-score tokens. Once being used as collaterals, they offer high loan-to-value ratios to borrowers; lenders also get favorable lending interest rates with their high-credit-score tokens. Users can improve their credit scores once they possess those high-valuable digital assets.']",[],[],"['https://docs.trava.finance/faq/trava-credit-score', 'https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/credit-score-evaluation']"
How the user's credit score will be updated?,0,False,"['Our system has both periodic updates and instant updates.

We are still trying to optimize it. ', 'To evaluate credit scores for a wallet address, TRAVA.FINANCE credit scoring model will take into account the following factors: Total asset. The total asset represents the financial strength of the wallet address; it is the most intuitive and easiest-to-evaluate parameter. It is also the second most important parameter that affects credit scores. The total asset is the sum of balance and total investment minus total liabilities. The credit score of the address is proportional to its total asset. As this parameter is a volatility index, the credit score is calculated based on both the average total asset in a certain period and the total current asset. Transaction history. Transaction history is the most important parameter; it has a major impact on credit scores. TRAVA.FINANCE collects and aggregates all exchanges, loans, deposits, and other transactions of the wallet address across multiple DApps to calculate various intermediate parameters such as (i) the age of the address, (ii) its transaction amount, (iii) its frequency of transaction, (iv) its number of liquidations and (v) its total value of liquidations. Loan ratios. Loan ratios (debt ratios) represent the debt position of the account. It is divided into two sub-parameters, i.e., loan-to-balance ratio and loan-to-investment ratio. Circulating assets. This parameter represents how active users are in the crypto market. The more money they invest in the crypto market, the more creditworthiness they gain from others. This parameter is evaluated based on 2 sub-parameters, (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE (Return on equity). Trustworthiness of possessing assets. The last parameter for credit rating is the trustworthiness of the assets owned by the wallet address. The wallet can improve its credit score by possessing high-value and trustworthy digital assets.

Besides, you need to be credible users for a long time. It is because to avoid fraud, TRAVA calculates some credit score parameters based on their average values in the last k days, where k depends on the volatility of the crypto market.

How to attend Trava NFT Auction?,0,False,"['Rules Auction is ONLY cancellable when it has NO BIDS. After the first bid comes in, neither you nor we can cancel it, as rules are written in the smart contract. When the bidding countdown is less than 5 minutes left, every new bid will extend the countdown by 5 minutes; Each bid price will be increased by at least 5% of the previous one. Once the countdown ends, the auction item will be obtained by the last/highest bidder; The most important rule: 2.5% of the price increase for each bid is distributed to the previous bidder, and the remaining 97.5% would be the income of the auction publisher if it’s the last bid or returned to the bidder when it’s outbid. With the rules, each bidder would either take the 5% share of the next bid or obtain the auction Knight with the price he/she offered. And the first bidder will additionally be free from distributing his/her own 5% to other people. Note: The percentage that the later bidder pays for the earlier bidder is the same as the percentage that the sellers need to pay for the platform. So, 2.5% is also the amount auction publishers pay to the marketplace, which means that after receiving 97.5% of the final bidding price as income, sellers need to pay 2.5% of the income to the NFT marketplace. Therefore, the final payment rate that the sellers receive is 95.06% of the final bid. This fee is utilized for marketing, operating, and functioning.

Secondly, Billy offered 1100 TRAVA ⇒ Alice would receive her own 1000 TRAVA and 2.5% of 1100 TRAVA, which would be 1027.5 TRAVA in total, and the extra 27.5 TRAVA is totally free money. Finally, Michael offered 1200 TRAVA. ⇒ Then, Billy would get 97.5% of his 1100 TRAVA and 2.5% of 1200 TRAVA, that is 1102.5 TRAVA, still getting 30 TRAVA for free. ⇒ The auction publisher will receive ~ 95.06% of the final bidding price (1200 TRAVA).

What are benefit for those who participate in the Trava Knight auction?,0,False,"['Benefit for those who participate in the Trava Knight auction Benefit for auction publishers (the sellers) Auction publishers (or sellers) are those who open auctions for their Knights. Opening an auction allows auction publishers to set up their price floor for their Knights, which determines their minimum desired price, helping them avoid selling their Knights at an unwanted low price compared to the market price. The auction opens a great opportunity for Knight owners to make profits without the need of disassembling their Knights to pieces and selling each item multiple times, which can cause wasted gas fees due to multiple transactions. Benefit for bidders Trava Knight auction is of benefit for bidders since it offers them the opportunity to get the full Knight, not every piece of armoury NFT on Trava NFT Marketplace. This helps bidders save more time in obtaining a Knight without finding and collecting armoury items to assemble. The auction also offers bidders an excellent method to get their favorable Knights, which suits their needs for missions such as Farming, Expedition, Farming with EXP and PvP tournaments in the future. Benefit for Trava Lending Pool The NFT Auction is the first step toward Trava Finance’s long-term aim of allowing NFTs to be used as collateral in the Trava Lending pool. By using an auction mechanism, the NFT will be priced and subsequently used as collateral in the Trava loan pool. This is a good method to vary the collaterals and give users more opportunities to lend assets.  ', 'Benefits of Knight NFTs Each of Knight and Armory NFTs represents a unique digital collectible that can be bought, sold, rented and put on auction on Trava Knight NFT Marketplace. It helps increase the utility of not only NFTs for NFT-collateralization, but also $TRAVA in our system as all the trading on the Marketplace is in $TRAVA. Users can assemble Knight NFTs to join Trava Farming Programs (NFT Farming, Heuristic Farming) in different vaults for a great APY — the rarer the NFT, the higher APY. The longer staked in the vaults, Loyal Knight NFT holders will also have more benefits in our lending pool in the future. In addition, you can get rewards from Trava Knight NFTs by playing the Battle Hand Mini-Game, and joining in Missions such as Expedition or Treasure Map.  ', 'TRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below. NFT owners can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it. TRAVA.FINANCE thus increases the liquidity of NFTs and opens up a unique and exciting NFTFi marketplace. Based on the given number of auction bids, bidders have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session. This rewarding mechanism provides incentives for users to actively make a bid in the auction. Auction winners can get their desired NFT at a price lower than their bidding price (once NFT owners cannot repay the loan) or they can receive considerable interest from their loan to NFT owners (once NFT owners repay the loans and get their NFT back). The credit scores of NFT owners, auction winners, bidders, and NFTs can be improved after auctions. The auction mechanism for NFT can also be applied to any type of digital asset.

What is EXP points and how to earn them?,0,False,"['EXP points At the moment, EXP (Experience Point) is the point that shows how long an Armoury NFT is staked in our vaults. EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault. Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault We’ve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items). You can see your EXP  either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace.    Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs.

What are the features of Trava Finance?,0,False,"['There are six salient features of TRAVA.FINANCE, including: Crypto lending marketplace: TRAVA.FINANCE creates a marketplace in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and obtain greater earnings. Semantic knowledge graph: TRAVA.FINANCE is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA.FINANCE to efficiently search for useful information such as (i) the amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses; (ii) the provenance of an NFT; (iii) aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc. Data analysis: To reduce lending risks, TRAVA.FINANCE performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA.FINANCE recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, Loan to Value ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA.FINANCE also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools. Credit score evaluation: Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can (i) reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool; and (ii) stimulate borrowing by defining a high Loan to Value ratio for borrowers with high credit scores. Cross-chain identification and cross-chain lending: TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross- chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores. NFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals: To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA.FINANCE allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn considerable amounts from the contract. ']",[],[],['https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper']

Explain in details Trava governace v1 and the vision for version 2,0,False,"['Governance v1  For version 1 of Trava Governance, we present evolution in governance processes with on-chain features enabled. Governance Process  The governance process consists of 2 continuous processes: off-chain & on-chain.      Off-chain process:  In the off-chain process, anyone in the Trava community can raise their opinions and discuss ideas of how the protocol can improve by creating TRC - Trava Request for Comments on the Trava Forum.  After an idea is well-formed, a community member can follow our template for TIP - Trava Improvement Proposal and post on the forum for details feedback. We recommend off-chain voting (powered by snapshot.org) to gain exposure and rough consensus from the community to increase the chance of succeeding in the on-chain process.  When a TIP gets to its final version, the DAO Committee is in charge of the review process and officially proposes on-chain.      On-chain process:  When a TIP is proposed on-chain, it becomes transparent on the public blockchain; anyone possessing voting power can directly vote for or against this proposal.  After the voting period, a TIP will be queued and executed by the public.  The Security Advisory Board acts as a guardian to prevent malicious actions and security exploits in this process. Governance Authority  In governance version 1, the DAO will have authority over the Trava lending protocol. The community will have to agree on any significant changes or updates through the on-chain process. Governance Power  To gain governance power, holders need to lock their Trava or rTrava token in exchange for the veTRAVA token, which holds voting power. This vote locking mechanism encourages users who show a solid commitment to the protocol with more governance power and incentive.', 'In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1  In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc.  In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including:      Discussion: In this stage, Trava holders will discuss different problems on the Trava Forum.     Proposal: On this forum, once a person brings his or her ideas to the platform, the community will determine whether they should be considered by up-voting this proposal. If the community approves, it will be brought on the snapshot in the next step.     Voting off-chain on the snapshot: On the snapshot, users will vote for the proposition they want.     Voting on-chain: After the voting on the snapshot, the whole governance process will then be generated totally on-chain.     Execution: After the stage of making the decision, there are two scenarios. If the proposal is accepted, it will be executed; otherwise, it will be canceled.  In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: the amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time.  Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features:      Democracy: The voting enforcement process is democratic and transparent.     Connectivity: The community members can recommend, discuss, and manage the products and the development direction of the Trava Ecosystem.     Up-to-date: The community members can recommend the latest technologies and features based on the market trend that help the whole system make changes to the protocol for the best result.  The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2  Trava is the first one that allows users to create and manage their own lending pool. In the future, governance will play a significant role in the initialization movements and their operation in the future.  In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process.  Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.']",[],[],"['https://docs.trava.finance/governance/dao', 'https://blog.trava.finance/trava-governance-the-vision-of-trava-protocol-644cbbcec263']"

To fulfill the “decentralized” part of the Trava Decentralized Marketplace, we launched Trava Governance, based on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model, to give users decision-making power. In this case, veTRAVA, in the form of NFT, represents this power and is determined by the time and amount of locked tokens (as they show your commitment toward the future of Trava Finance).  With the implementation of the Trava Governance Vault, users can lock their TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB into this vault to receive a certain amount of veTRAVA representing their powers: the more veTRAVA you own, the higher your voting power in the Trava ecosystem. The Benefits Of Owning veTRAVA  The key value of veTRAVA is its representative of users’ power and their commitment to the project. As a result, in the long term, users who own veTRAVA can receive significant benefits:      Deciding on crucial parameters such as LTV, risk parameters, etc., in the lending pools (Trava Lending Pool and Users-owned Pools).     Receiving share profit coming from the fee charged by borrowers     Receiving boosting rewards in rTRAVA by providing liquidity and holding veTRAVA at the same time.     Earning TRAVA reward: the APR will be revealed soon.  As mentioned, veTRAVA is utilized as a form of NFT. For now, it can only be available for those who lock their token into the Governance Vault. However, it will be exchanged peer-to-peer with the launch of veTRAVA Marketplace. veTRAVA Marketplace: Overview  As its name suggests, the veTRAVA marketplace is for users to buy and sell their veTRAVA. It means they can freely exchange their voting power. The main reason we came up with this idea is to optimize users’ experience, bringing them as much freedom as possible. It’s the “Decentralization” we are heading for.  Besides bringing more freedom to users, veTRAVA Marketplace increases liquidity for veTRAVA and thus benefits both sellers and buyers. In more detail, buyers can buy veTRAVA (voting power) easily on Marketplace and then earn voting power immediately. In this case, the remaining locking time will be more flexible, no longer limited to a particular period set in the Governance Vault. When it comes to sellers, they can easily utilize crypto assets in a more liberal way and get benefits from it. The Influences of veTRAVA Marketplace  veTRAVA Marketplace is an important feature that contributes to the development of Trava Governance. As mentioned above, users who hold many veTRAVA will have a crucial role in the decision-making process of the Trava Finance ecosystem. The veTRAVA holders can alternate the voting results, and through the Marketplace, users can buy or sell the voting power with others.  With the fact that users can trade their voting power to each other, anyone in the ecosystem will have a chance to vote for the changes they want to make in Trava Finance. The more users have veTRAVA, the more voting power is distributed, and users will be given the full power to make the decisions that can affect the Decentralized Lending Marketplace, which will elevate the decentralized side of Trava Finance’s ultimate goal.']",[],[],"['https://docs.trava.finance/governance/locker', 'https://docs.trava.finance/user-guide/vetrava-marketplace-user-guide', 'https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-vetrava-marketplace-c9092a0c51c8']"
What is health factor and how is it calculated exactly?,0,False,"['What is Health factor?  Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value.

The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation?  The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated.

Assessing the codebase to ensure compliance with current best practices and industry standards.      Ensuring contract logic meets the specifications and intentions of the client.      Cross-referencing contract structure and implementation against similar smart contracts produced by industry leaders.      Thorough line-by-line manual review of the entire codebase by industry experts  Findings:  There are seven issues found in total, including 1 Minor Finding, 2 Informational Findings, and 4 Major Findings.  Firstly, one Minor and Two Informational Issues concern some coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused functions, missing zero addresses checking, and function type. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.  Secondly, all four Major Issues are related to Centralization. The owners of the following contracts below can execute some functions without obtaining the consensus of the community:      FactoryRegistry,      AddressesProviderFactory      PoolUpdateControl      LendingPoolConfigurator   Certik Recommendations for the Centralization Issue:  Certik advised to carefully manage the governance/guardian account’s private key to avoid any potential risks of being hacked. In general, Certik strongly recommended centralized privileges or roles in the protocol to be improved via a decentralized mechanism or via smart-contract-based accounts with enhanced security practices, e.g. Multisignature wallets.  Some feasible solutions recommended by Certik that would also mitigate the potential risk include:      Time-lock with reasonable latency, i.e. 48 hours, for awareness on privileged operations;      Assignment of privileged roles to multi-signature wallets to prevent a single point of failure due to the private key;      Introduction of a DAO/governance/voting module to increase transparency and user involvement.  Trava Solutions for the Centralization Issue  Trava has partially resolved these issues via smart-contract-based accounts. In particular:      Deploy a Multi-Signature wallet in BSC mainnet at the address:   0xdF73aC573Dfd430f4C5558B8CbeD86e86145501B      Set up the owner of the contracts and governance to the multi-signature wallet.

The audit report contains all found security vulnerabilities and other issues in the reviewed code. As a result of the audit, There are no critical issues in our contracts. Besides, Hacken’s security engineers found 4 high, 4 medium, and 3 low severity issues. Overall, after the auditing process, Hacken evaluated Trava’s contracts as Well-Secured (the highest level of security as the assessment). Severity High  There is one issue regarding the implementation function and three issues regarding uninitialized state variables:      Issue 1 (unimplemented function): The logic of function finalizeTranfer has commented-out unimplemented logic. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.      Issues 2, 3, 4 (uninitialized state variables): Some state variables are not initialized for the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager but they are being called.          Trava’s Response: We consider the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager as a Logic Contract where we execute our code by using delegate call from LendingPool Contract. That explains why we don’t initialize the state for that variable.          Following the verification, Hacken determined that these are not issues.  Severity Medium  There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused imports, Not checked contract address, and No event on lendingPoolConfigurator change. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.  There is one Issue concerning Possible FlashLoan attack in the LendingPool contract. Despite the fact that we do not believe this attack could happen in real life, we took great care in resolving the problem.  Description: IF both of TToken and its underlyingAsset are traded on multiple DEXes and have different rates there could be a FlashLoan attack. Attackers could FlashLoan a TToken, and process withdraw, which will give then the exact same amount of the underlyingAsset, and then calling deposit, they will receive the same amount of TToken.  Having the 1-to-1 “exchange” on the LendingPool and different rates on DEXes, attackers could “play” with the market many times in one transaction until they receive enough rewards. The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.  The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.  Hacken’s Recommendation: Consider some restrictions like minting/returning assets in the next block only.  Trava’s solution: Token transfer restrictions for transferring in the same block where minting occurred.  After the verification, Hacken concluded that the issue had been resolved completely. Severity Low  There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to Unused state variable, public/external function, Unused function argument.

Explain EXP and how can I use it for Farming,0,False,"['At the moment, EXP (Experience Point) is the point that shows how long an Armoury NFT is staked in our vaults. EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault.  Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault  We’ve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items).  You can see your EXP  either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace.  Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs. However, when you withdraw your Knight NFT, disassemble and reassemble with different items to get another Knight NFT, your Armoury NFTs will have different EXPs.  For example: You open 4 chests and get: Helmet, Shield, Armour and Weapon. You assemble them into a Knight NFT and farm in our vault. After 24h, the EXPs for Armoury NFTs are as follow:      Weapon EXP: 86400      Shield EXP: 86400      Armor EXP: 86400      Helmet EXP: 86400  So EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400 (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400  After 24h, you withdraw your Knight NFT to reassemble with Armoury NFTs you buy on Trava NFT Marketplace. Suppose, those Armoury NFTs you bought have been already farmed in vault before and have the EXPs as follow:      Weapon EXP: 86400      Shield EXP: 100000      Armor EXP: 320000      Helmet EXP: 210000  Thus, the EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100 (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100  There will be a lot of benefits for NFT owners to have high EXPs. The more EXP you have, the more value the NFT will be. This can help you to distinguish NFT value from other NFTs of the same type and rarity. Moreover, the EXP will be applied in our Trade-up Mechanism which will be launched soon. In the future, EXP will be used with Credit Score and applied to NFT-collateralization. It can be said that EXP is an important factor in Trava Knight NFT to reach our goal of collateralization.', 'Heuristic Farming (Farming based on EXP)  When the new Farming mechanism commences, our 5 current Farming vaults will stop distributing TRAVA as reward, which means our 5 existing vaults will only give back EXP (one EXP for each second in 5 current farming vaults). This change supports NFT owners to gain EXP to enter Heuristic Farming with better rewards.  In the new Farming mechanism, we provide  5 more vaults for Heuristic Farming, and you can deposit as many knights as you want into each Vault, provided that those knights have the same rarity as that Vault. Rewards from Heuristic Farming are rTRAVA tokens and EXP (one EXP for every 3 seconds in the vault). The higher EXP, the higher the APR, the higher the rTRAVA reward.

Like the current Farming mechanism, Heuristic Farming also has a Polishing mechanism. The polishing mechanism in Heuristic Farming helps NFT owners maintain 100% rewards and supports increasing EXP and APY.  Note that, Knights with 0 EXP still gain rewards from Heuristic Farming. Moreover, with rTRAVA from Heuristic Farming, users can auto-stake in our rTRAVA with no locking period in our Staking Program. rTRAVA then can be locked in Trava Governance vault to gain locking power as veTRAVA and earn more rewards.

What is Token Health and how can it measure a crypto risk?,0,False,"['What is Token Health?  Token Health is an index to evaluate the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava is the world-first lending platform that provides this index by collecting and aggregating various types of data from blockchain networks. The health of each token is evaluated as a specific value in the range of [0; 1000]. This health index gives the users a comprehensive overview of tokens in the cryptocurrency world and thus facilitates TRAVA lending and other DEFI businesses. Original features in Trava Token Health  Standardizing value for each indicator: There have been a few projects providing information on tokens such as Coingecko, CoinMarketCap, LunarCrush, CREAM Finance, DMM Exchange, etc. They typically present multiple types of on-chain data represented by raw numbers only. For example, they show the market capitalization of tokens but do not standardize those values, which makes it harder for users to understand the meaning of the values or make a comparison among different tokens. Performing standardization for the numeric indicators, Trava allows users to quickly assess different tokens in terms of MarketCap, Trading Volume, Token Price, etc.  Aggregate all indicators into a single index: Similar projects simply present multiple token indicators to users without combining them into a single index to make a comprehensive assessment of tokens. Trava Token Health Model, which is a user-oriented model, has been built to address this inconvenience by computing those separate indicators and combining all of them into an insightful index, i.e., Token Health. Users can use this single value to evaluate the health of a token and can quickly decide to invest in the token or not.  Utilizing both absolute and relative indicators: The absolute indicators are commonly used in many token-analyzing projects, while relative values are typically being overlooked. The absolute and separated values do not provide many complete insights, as those values \u200b\u200bare not correlated with each other. Different from other projects, Trava makes use of both absolute and relative indicators to evaluate the Token Health in the most precise and overall manner. Let us take an example with tokens A and B. The trading volume of token A is $100M, while that of token B is $10M. People tend to quickly jump to the conclusion that token A outweighs token B with regards to the trading volume. However, when considering the market cap of the two tokens, it shows that the MarketCap of token A is 1000 times greater than that of token A. Thus, in the correlation with the MarketCap, the trading volume of token B is in fact much more impressive than that of token A. The example shows that, by combining absolute and relative indicators, Trava Model provides more comprehensive insights compared with related projects.  Customized UI for each user: The UI for Trava Token Heath can be customized for individual preference. Trava provides users with the leaderboard of all tokens, ranked by the total score (i.e., Token Health) or other single indicators such as market cap, token price, and trading volume. Users can access the historical charts of each indicator to get more insights. Moreover, what makes Trava Token Health special compared to the related projects is that Trava enables users to customize the charts based on their preferences. For example, they can add their favorite tokens with their preferable indicators in a single chart to compare and evaluate multiple tokens in an easy, time-saving, and elegant manner.  Various types of indicators: The Trava Token Health model is constructed based on various parameters in different aspects of DeFi. There are seven main parameters; all are selected and analyzed under a strict process before being deployed to ensure the most reliability and creditworthiness. In addition to the absolute values, we also calculate and analyze the relative values such as: the price over the highest score or the trading volume over the MarketCap. We also consider the fluctuation of the values over time. The detailed model will be presented in the next section Trava Token Health model  Trava has studied and developed an exclusive token rating model. The model takes into account various types of data. At present, the data is grouped into seven main indicators including (1) Market cap, (2) Number of transactions, (3) Volume of transactions, (4) Number of holders, (5) Distribution of tokens to holders, (6) Price, and (7) Price stability. Each indicator in turn is evaluated based on several sub-parameters. The use of Trava Token Health  One of the significant benefits of Token Health is to reduce risks. When participating in the crypto world, users have to face many types of risks such as token price crashes or collateral liquidation when borrowing. Token Health will be a useful tool for users to minimize these risks. They can determine which tokens should not be invested at certain times to avoid risks. Let us take an example of how two major risks can be addressed by Trava Token Health:      Risk of token liquidity. In the DeFi field, price fluctuations can result in risks of loan liquidation for both the pool owners and liquidity providers. With Trava Token Health, the pool owner can choose stable price tokens to allow performing actions in the pool to avoid this risk.     Risk of token inflation. Tokens with high inflation are more likely to have a price crash. Users in DeFi can suffer significant losses due to such crashes. With Trava Token Health, users have a full overview of token price, using our price stability indicator, the price over the highest score, or the Token Health index. This information is an effective tool for users to avoid the risk of tokens’ price crashes.  Moreover, Trava Token Health assists users to make optimal decisions on token investing. In the past, choosing which tokens to invest, lend or borrow, was a major problem for users in the crypto world because there was no credible basis for them to assess the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava Token Health allows users to observe the history of multiple token indicators and the overall Token Health index to be more confident when making their investment decisions.']",[],[],['https://blog.trava.finance/introducing-alpha-version-of-trava-token-health-57afe1fa3456']
Who are trava governance security advisory board and what are other components in trava governance?,0,False,"['In the big picture, there are four essential components in Trava Governance: the Trava community, the DAO Committee, the Security Advisory Board (SAB), and Governance Portal & smart contracts.      Trava community: The most valuable resource of ideas, discussions & feedback for protocol changes. Everyone can raise their voice & share their opinion on Trava Forum or any community social channels.      DAO Committee: The entrusted individuals in the Trava community to submit proposals after a thorough review with discussion & feedback.      Security Advisory Board: The guardian for the protocol’s security when some malicious actions are aimed at the protocol or in unexpected events.      Governance Portal & Smart contracts: The autonomous “Hand of the King” consists of governance contracts for on-chain voting and multiple timelocks governing and automating the changes & updates of Trava Ecosystem’s smart contracts. That keeps the governance process public and transparent to everyone.', 'Who are they?  Given the crucial role of the SAB, in the beginning, this team combines experts who also take responsibility for the development of the Trava Ecosystem as a whole.  We would like to introduce the SAB team as below:      Mr. Minh Nguyen — CEO & Co-founder of Trava Finance     Mr. Duc Tran — Head of Security & Co-founder of Trava Finance     Mr. Thang Nguyen — CTO & Co-founder of Trava Finance     Mr. Quan Dinh — CPO & Co-founder of Trava Finance     Mr. Chung Dao — Strategy Advisor of Trava Finance- CEO & Co-founder Oraichain  First, the security advisor board includes five people from the team, as mentioned above.

Explain TRADAO and its public offering.,0,False,"['What is TRADAO?  TRADAO is the world’s first protocol supporting multi-chain deployment in DeFi 2.0, and also Web 3.0 compatible. TraDAO is protocol owned liquidity (POL), accumulating value through such activities of bonding and auto-compound staking which are regulated by Trava Treasury. As a product in Trava ecosystem, the liquidity owned by TRADAO protocol could be deposited in Trava Lending Pool to generate more profit and this profit will be shared among users in the entire Trava ecosystem.  TRADAO Protocol will issue a decentralized reserve currency — called TOD. The concept behind TOD token is that it is backed by a basket of assets in Trava Treasury that ensures it does not fall below its base value of $1. The TOD token will be released based on the “Mint & Burn” mechanism, managed by no one other than TRADAO protocol. Why is TRADAO different compared to other OHM forks?  In comparison to other initiatives in the DeFi 2.0 space, TRADAO Protocol offers a number of unique advantages to users. How does it work?  Our Bonding allows users to buy TOD at a discounted price compared with exchanges in other assets such as stablecoins, LP tokens, and so on. The number of TOD tokens that the bonder is entitled to will be vested in a certain term.  Bond Installment is a one-of-a-kind feature that allows users to buy more TOD with a little initial amount of assets, then leverage benefits in Staking Strategy, and pay off the debt. Your bond shall be automatically staked after you use Bond Installment.  Wallet Reputation will be integrated with this product in the form of a reference to decide which user will have more benefits (i.e, lower prepaid rate, lower interest fee rate, higher liquidation discount rate,…). For example, holding assets in the Trava Ecosystem can be considered as a condition to gain a high wallet reputation.  Our Staking allows bonders to stake their TOD token in our auto-compounding vault and earn rebase rewards, after receiving TOD tokens from bond sales. The rebase rewards are also from bond sales held in Trava treasury, or profit of the protocol.', 'We are opening two public offering rounds to give our loyal users as well as our new investors more opportunities to take part in the TraDAO Protocol at the very first stage. In both rounds, participants will buy $TOD tokens in BUSD. The details of two rounds are as the table below:  To get off to a good start, Trava will contribute to TraDAO Protocol with $50,000 worth of 20,000 $TOD tokens. This support is to ensure initial liquidity of $TOD and show the commitment of Trava team in developing TraDAO protocol, thus bringing trust to our community and staying the true ideology of Trava since the beginning, that is a fair launch project and independent of any whale or VCs. The funds from sale will be used to back the $TOD sold and provide initial liquidity after listing.  If we are 100% subscribed, the sale will bring in $345,000. $105,000 will be deposited to the treasury to back initial supply. The remaining $240,000 will be added as liquidity. The LP will open on PancakeSwap with 240,000 BUSD and 20,000 $TOD, in addition to 85,000 $TOD from Public Offering and contribution of Trava Team. This means the starting price of $TOD is $12, and total initial liquidity on Pancakeswap is $480,000 of both tokens. Thus, the total Initial Supply of $TOD will be 105,000 $TOD. How can I join Public Offering?  We will also open two (02) Rounds of Whitelist, which will then be merged to one Final Whitelist at the end. The two rounds open to welcome new Knights and incentives for Loyal Knights in the TRAVA ecosystem as follows:      Whitelist Round 1 (will be live on Jan 21st) — Power up TRADAO — To welcome new members into TRAVA Ecosystem     Whitelist Round 2 (will be live on Jan 28th) — Cheer up Trava Knights — To honor TRAVA loyal users  Participants in the Final Whitelist will have a lucky ticket in buying $TOD Token at the cheapest price before it hits the official launch on PancakeSwap. When you buy, you are removed from the whitelist; if some people buy less than their share, everyone who has not yet bought will get a higher allocation. The details of each Round will be released in our next announcements.  After the public offering rounds, we plan to open two strategies of Bonding and Staking for users to leverage their rewards and earn profit from them. We also have a plan to allow Bond Installment and Wallet Reputation for Bond purchases, which creates a perfect gateway for users with small funds to invest and profit from the protocol.']",[],[],"['https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-tradao-protocol-a-breakthrough-into-defi-2-0-d549c782422c', 'https://blog.trava.finance/tradao-public-offering-announcement-eda810f6cb2']"
