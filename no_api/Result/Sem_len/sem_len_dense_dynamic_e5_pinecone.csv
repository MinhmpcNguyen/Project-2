Last updated 3 years ago Was this helpful?', 'Introduction to Trava Ticket: What is Trava Ticket? A ticket in Trava Finance is an exchangeable asset that allows users to own additional perks or access to products in the Trava Ecosystem. There are three types of tickets: Counter Ticket, Presale Ticket, and Incentive Ticket. Each has different usages, as described more thoroughly in the next part. What is it used for? As defined above, the Trava tickets carry out two primary uses: to exchange and access the Trava Ecosystem. Specifically, users can buy or sell these tickets on Trava Counter or Ticket Marketplace (the details in the next part) to earn profits from trading activities. In addition, as its name — “Ticket” — this asset will be needed to participate in various programs in the Trava Ecosystem, including Trava NFT (farming, buying chest, etc. ), Trava Lending (governance, bridge, NFT collateralization) or TraDAO, which might be rebranded to Trava Capital (based on community decision). Trava Counter, Ticket Marketplace, and three types of Ticket _Trava Counter and Ticket Marketplace_: Trava Counter and Ticket Marketplace are two platforms for users to exchange tickets. While the former is for trading with the protocol, the latter is for selling or buying peer-to-peer. Another fundamental difference between these two is the price determination method. - On Trava Counter: The counter price increases/decreases depending on the ticket demand but will always be maintained at a minimum of $1. Besides buying tickets, users can also sell these assets to the protocol at 80% of the current counter price. In fact, users can benefit from buying tickets and selling them at a higher price. For example, assuming that users buy tickets at 1$, two weeks later, if the current counter price increases to $2 because of the increasing demand, they can earn profits by selling these tickets at 1,6$ (80% of $2) to the protocol. - On the marketplace: The price will be determined by the sellers and buyers themselves. _Three types of Ticket_: As mentioned above, there are different types of tickets: - Counter Ticket: Tickets bought from Trava Counter - Presale Ticket: Tickets bought from the presale program - Incentive Ticket: Tickets earned as rewards while participating in various Trava programs. _The fundamental exchange mechanism_: Each type of ticket has its exchange mechanism, which can be simplified in the table below: Crucial note: As mentioned, the Ticketomics combine both max circulating supply and mint/burn mechanism, which means we ensure the max circulating supply will be fixed at a certain number. With this innovative idea, we long to enrich the whole ecosystem. Given that Trava Finance has developed various features and products, utilities of Trava Ticket will be applied right after its launch. In the long term, more and more features will be released gradually to enhance users’ experience. : Trava Ticket Utilities Ticket will be implemented in the main products of Trava Finance, including Trava Knight NFT, Trava Lending, Trava Capital, and also the MiniGame Series. Moreover, the Ticket can be sold to Trava Protocol or other owners as an exchangeable asset to gain more profit. Trava Knight NFT: In Trava Knight NFT, Trava Ticket can be used in Missions, including Treasure Map and Expedition, as well as an asset to exchange for Chest and receive Armoury to assemble Knights. In the upcoming feature of Trava Knight NFT, the Treasure Map, Ticket will be utilized as an entrance ticket. Players must have a Ticket to enter the missions in Treasure Map. By joining Treasure Map, users can have the opportunity of earning more Tickets and other rewards. Moreover, Ticket will boost the success rate in the Expedition feature. When a user has a Ticket, their success rate after finishing a mission in Expedition is much higher. To enter Expedition, users have to pay a small entrance fee, but the rewards are very worthy, especially now with the enhancement of owning a Ticket. Lastly, the essential utility of Ticket is the capability of exchanging Ticket for Chest and receiving Armoury to build a full Trava Knight. With this utility, users will have chances to enter the Trava Kingdom without paying a large amount of money to buy Knights directly from the Marketplace. Furthermore, with the assembled Knights, users can join in Mission features in Trava Knight NFT, including Farming to gain rewards and EXP, joining Expedition and earn rewards, Incentive Tickets, EXP, etc. In the future, Tickets will be implemented in the PvP Tournament in Trava Knight NFT. More details are coming soon! Trava Lending: With the ownership of Trava Ticket, users will be able to change the time/balance lock in Trava Governance even after you have locked your investment in. Another utility of Ticket in Trava Lending is that users can make use of the Ticket to withdraw rewards in Governance earlier. Moreover, users can use Ticket to exchange for multiple transactions in Bridge, which helps the transaction process faster and more conveniently.']","['https://gov.trava.finance/register', 'https://gov.trava.finance/login', 'https://gov.trava.finance/user/henry/topics', 'https://gov.trava.finance/users', 'https://blog.trava.finance/about?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203---------------------------------', 'https://docs.trava.finance/portal/developers', 'https://docs.trava.finance/nfts/trava-nft-ticket']","['https://blog.trava.finance/trava-tokenomics-for-a-strategic-vision-a8098eaac5af', 'https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/tokenomics']"

After the Trava Lottery and Battlehand, the next game — Fortune Mining, will be soon published on September 8th 2022. Introduction to fortune mining What is Fortune Mining? As mentioned, this is an important component of the Trava Minigame Series. The game is built on the well-known blockchain idea of the No-loss-rewards game, allowing participants to earn big prizes without worrying about losing their money. How does it work? So how exactly does Fortune Mining work? For more details, users first need to deposit their money into the Fortune Mining Pool. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm). That means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones. The benefit Fortune Mining brings to players. _No loss to worry about_: As the old saying goes, “More risk brings higher return.” However, with Fortune Mining, players will not need to worry about their losses. Because of the unique mechanism, there will be no loss, and unlucky players can get their deposits back after a certain period. _Big prize to look for_: While there is no loss to be concerned about, the winner may earn significantly more benefits than they would if they had deposited into the regular pool. For example , assuming that we run a Fortune Mining pool for users to deposit DAI and gain 20.000 DAI in total deposited after one week. With APY at 1.5% (that is converted to APR at about 0,92%) and APR at 4.08%, respectively, two weeks later, the total reward for the winner will be calculated as: _20000 (0.92%+ 4.08%)/365 14 = 38.356 DAI._ That means if you deposit 100 DAI at first and become the lucky one, you will receive about $38,356 (the interest rate at about 1000%) instead of $0,19 (the interest rate at about 5%). As in the example above, the gap between the rewards you could get in a normal pool and the Fortune Mining pool is very significant. For that reason, this mini-game will be a good choice for those with small capital to try their luck and get much more money than usual. To sum up, what do you need to do to attain the benefits? Step 1. Deposit your token into the Fortune Mining Pool Step 2. Waiting for a certain period (depending on each campaign) Step 3 . Check the result: * If you are the lucky one: Congratulations, you get all the rewards from the pool * If you have not been lucky yet, don’t worry, you can withdraw your deposit or keep them in the pool, then try your luck in the next period. Notes: We will soon run a voting snapshot for our community to decide which asset should be put in the Fortune Mining pool. Stay tuned for that.

It means you would be no longer entitled to the potential upside value gain. Whereas, by borrowing, you can still obtain these potential earnings (working capital) without losing your asset. You can borrow when unexpected expenses happen and leverage your holding assets for other investment opportunities. How to borrow? : In order to borrow, you need to deposit any asset to be used as collateral first (check out the Depositing & Earning FAQ section for more info). After depositing, you simply go to the “Borrow” section and click the “Borrow” button on the asset you want to borrow. Input the amount and approve the transaction. The borrowed amount is based on the available deposits that you used as collateral. What is the maximum amount can I borrow? : The maximum amount you can borrow depends on your deposited value and the available liquidity. Please notice the health factor and liquidation threshold indicators to guarantee your collaterals are in the state of safety. Besides, you can not borrow if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor is too low. What type of asset do I repay my loans? : When repaying a loan, the type of asset that you need to repay is in the same asset you borrowed.

If you want to pay back the loan based on USD price you can borrow any of the available stable coins as USDC, DAI, USDT, etc. How much interest would I pay for my loans? : When borrowing, the interest rate you need to pay depends on the borrowing rate which is determined from the supply and demand ratio of the asset. Moreover, the interest rate is a variable rate so that it changes constantly. The current borrowing rate of your borrowed assets is shown in the Borrowing section of your dashboard, you can check it any time. What is Health factor? : Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation? : The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals. When do I need to repay the loan? : As long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan. However, the accrued interest of your borrowing will grow day by day, making your health factor decrease. When it reaches the threshold of liquidation, your deposited assets are more likely to fall into liquidation status. How to repay the loan? : In order to pay back the loan you go to the Borrowings section of your dashboard and click on the repay button for the asset you borrowed and want to repay. Select the amount to pay back and approve the transaction. PreviousStaking/Depositing & EarningNextTesting Trava Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?', ""Introduction: In borrowing, when a borrowers’ health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value, a liquidation process might happen. In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty? : The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated? : In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2.

How Credit scores for wallet addresses are calculated?,0.9637,True,"['To evaluate credit scores for wallet addresses, TRAVA credit scoring model will take into account 5 factors: Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address. Transaction history: TRAVA aggregates all transactions of a wallet address across all platforms to calculate various parameters such as (i) transaction amount, (ii) number of liquidations, etc. Loans ratio: represents the debt position of an account, including the Loan-to-balance ratio and Loan-to-investment ratio. Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range. The z-score is calculated from the mean and the standard deviation from every corresponding parameter of all accounts. To be more specific, you can read this function in TRAVA whitepaper.   ', 'The credit score evaluation in TRAVA.FINANCE is primarily based on on-chain data. At present, we collect, enrich, and analyze Binance Smart Chain transactions, including the native transferring transactions and the transactions to deposit, withdraw, repay, and borrow tokens generated from Binance Smart Chain lending DApps. The credit rating of digital assets helps pool owners and liquid providers to minimize liquidity risk.

Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. TRAVA.FINANCE uses credit scores to ensure the safety of the lending process. Pool owners and lenders can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. Based on the credit scores, they can determine the maximum Loan-To-Value ratio for borrowers. Borrowers with high credit scores get preferential treatment; they can borrow cryptos with more favorable interest rates and Loan-To-Value ratios. Credit scores provide an incentive for users to (i) hold their wallet addresses as long as possible and keep them clean, (ii) perform the cross-chain identification protocol to interlink their addresses, (iii) perform more transactions inside and outside TRAVA.FINANCE, and so on. This increases crypto liquidity and fosters the growth of the DeFi system. The credit score evaluation in TRAVA.FINANCE is primarily based on on-chain data. At present, we collect, enrich, and analyze Binance Smart Chain transactions, including the native transferring transactions and the transactions to deposit, withdraw, repay, and borrow tokens generated from Binance Smart Chain lending DApps. TRAVA.FINANCE evaluates credit scores for both wallet addresses and other digital assets. Wallet addresses operated for a long time with good transaction history (e.g., an address that has transactions with many other addresses, always pays debts on time, and performs transactions frequently) will have a high credit score. Pool owners can use credit scores as a criterion to select competent wallet addresses for their pool’s liquidity providers. The credit rating of digital assets helps pool owners and liquid providers to minimize liquidity risk. TRAVA.FINANCE divides digital assets into two categories: Tokens/coins and other digital assets (e.g., NFT, smart contracts, stoke tokens) and evaluates their credit scores. The credit score of a **Token** is assessed based on 4 parameters, i.e., (i) the token price, (ii) the market cap (MC) of the token, (iii) the token trading volume, and (iv) the number of transactions related to the token. High-credit-score tokens have a great advantage over low-credit-score tokens. Once being used as collaterals, they offer high loan-to-value ratios to borrowers; lenders also get favorable lending interest rates with their high-credit-score tokens. Users can improve their credit scores once they possess those high-valuable digital assets. TRAVA.FINANCE also performs credit ratings for other **digital assets such as NFT**. The credit scores for NFTs are estimated based on the number of times that they have been auctioned on TRAVA.FINANCE or other trusted platforms. NFTs’ scores should not depend on their price because their price is typically determined in an unreliable manner, based on the emotion and the preference of customers. To evaluate credit scores for a wallet address, TRAVA.FINANCE credit scoring model will take into account the following factors: * _Total asset_. The total asset represents the financial strength of the wallet address; it is the most intuitive and easiest-to-evaluate parameter. It is also the second most important parameter that affects credit scores. The total asset is the sum of balance and total investment minus total liabilities. The credit score of the address is proportional to its total asset. As this parameter is a volatility index, the credit score is calculated based on both the _average total asset_ in a certain period and the _total current asset_. * _Transaction history_. Transaction history is the most important parameter; it has a major impact on credit scores. TRAVA.FINANCE collects and aggregates all exchanges, loans, deposits, and other transactions of the wallet address across multiple DApps to calculate various intermediate parameters such as (i) the age of the address, (ii) its transaction amount, (iii) its frequency of transaction, (iv) its number of liquidations and (v) its total value of liquidations. * _Loan ratios_. Loan ratios (debt ratios) represent the debt position of the account. It is divided into two sub-parameters, i.e., loan-to-balance ratio and loan-to-investment ratio. * _Circulating assets_. This parameter represents how active users are in the crypto market. The more money they invest in the crypto market, the more creditworthiness they gain from others. This parameter is evaluated based on 2 sub-parameters, (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE (Return on equity). * _Trustworthiness of possessing assets_. The last parameter for credit rating is the trustworthiness of the assets owned by the wallet address. The wallet can improve its credit score by possessing high-value and trustworthy digital assets. At present, TRAVA.FINANCE evaluates two types of digital assets only (i.e, Token and NFT).

What is users’ credit score? : In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. What benefits does credit score brings to users? : -For borrowers, the primary benefit is that they can borrow with a ""preferential interest rate"" if their credit score is high. They can also receive higher loan-to-value-ratio compared to other users For lenders, who have high credit scores easily become LPs of different pools. Moreover, when they create a pool, their pool will have a higher credit score because the pool creator\'s credit score is also a criterion for the pool scoring. Especially, pool owners can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. How Credit scores for wallet addresses are calculated? : To evaluate credit scores for wallet addresses, TRAVA credit scoring model will take into account 5 factors: 1. Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address. 2. Transaction history: TRAVA aggregates all transactions of a wallet address across all platforms to calculate various parameters such as (i) transaction amount, (ii) number of liquidations, etc. 3. Loans ratio: represents the debt position of an account, including the Loan-to-balance ratio and Loan-to-investment ratio. 4. Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. 5. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range. The z-score is calculated from the mean and the standard deviation from every corresponding parameter of all accounts. To be more specific, you can read this function in TRAVA whitepaper. How the user\'s credit score will be updated? : Our system has both periodic updates and instant updates. The instant update occurs when users actively make transactions such as deposit, withdraw, repay... Or when users view their credit score on our app. In case a user has not viewed their credit score and had no transactions for a long time, their credit score is still updated periodically and automatically, which can be weekly or monthly. We are still trying to optimize it. Which objects does Trava evaluate credit score for? : At the moment, Trava has been evaluating the credit scores for 3 types of Objects: Wallet addresses (users), tokens, and NFTs. How to increase my credit score? : To improve the credit score of your wallet, you would need to take into account our five parameters, i.e., Total asset, Transaction history, Loans ratios, Circulating assets, and Trustworthiness of possessing assets. For instance, you should increase your wallet balance with prestige coins and tokens, perform more transactions and become more active in the crypto market, maintaining good Loan-to-balance and Loan-to-investment ratios, supply more liquidity to lending pools, trade on lending DApps to earn as much profit as you can, avoid collateral liquidation while borrowing, and possess at least $1000 valuable token (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, or BNB). Besides, you need to be credible users for a long time. It is because to avoid fraud, TRAVA calculates some credit score parameters based on their average values in the last k days, where k depends on the volatility of the crypto market. Moreover, some parameters are assessed based on the “standardized score” function, which calculates the mean and the standard deviation of all accounts’ parameters. Thus, trying to be the best at some criteria would improve your credit score too. Why did my credit score decrease? : The reasons why your credit score drops might be: You have bad transactions such as borrowing liquidations, your balance decrease, your borrowing rate is higher, you are not active enough, etc...You can read our white paper to understand how the credit score mechanism functions. https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/credit-score-evaluation PreviousTroubleshootingNextNFTs Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?', 'A: Age of the wallet (day) The period that the wallet has participated in the crypto market since its first transaction.

The graph and TRAVA.FINANCE protocols make independent blockchains interconnected and create the internet of hyper-linked blockchains, allowing DApps to address complex business in reality. Figure 3 shows an example of the knowledge graph. The circle represents an entity (or instance) of data such as a wallet address, a user, a lending pool, an NFT, or other types of digital assets. Each entity is associated with other entities in certain relationships, represented by directional arrows; the direction of an arrow is the direction of the relationship. The white rectangles are the values for the data attributes of the entity. The example graph shows that the WalletAddress2 is on the Ethereum network and that address owns an NFT. Aggregated information of the NFT, such as the highest bid price, number of auctions, list of addresses ever owned, etc., are also represented in the knowledge graph. Let us assume that a user creates one address on the Bitcoin network and one address on the Ethereum network. Because there were no relationships among these addresses, the knowledge graph creates two anonymous users, i.e., AnonymousUser1 and AnonymousUser2. AnonymousUser1 owns the Bitcoin addresses (i.e., WalletAddress3), and AnonymousUser2 has one Ethereum address, i.e., WalletAddress1. Various information related to a wallet address is stored in the graph. For example, the WalletAddress3 entity contains the _average balance_ , the _total amount of ETHs transferred in and out_ , the _total number of transactions_ , or _the average, median, mode,_ and _highest number of ETHs transferred in one transaction._ Assuming the user wants to increase his/her credit score or use up all of his/her cryptos as collateral for a loan, he or she can unify all addresses as one via the cross-chain identification protocol performed in only one TRAVA.FINANCE's transaction. After completing the transaction, the two anonymous users are linked by the _sameAs_ relationship. Depending on users’ needs, the cross-chain identification protocol also supports linking two wallet address entities by a _guarantee_ relationship. Once an address is lost, if all the addresses that guarantee the address confirm the loss, the address status will be claimed as _lost_ in the knowledge graph. Wallet addresses can also be connected by a _transfer_ relationship. To ensure scalability, rather than detailed transactions, statistical and aggregated information on transactions is calculated and stored in that _transfer_ relationship. As in the knowledge graph example above, several remarkable pieces of information are saved, including _BlockchainAddress1 has transferred 400 ETHs in total to BlockchainAddress2; it is performed through 10 transactions, and the largest transaction transfers 200 ETHs._ To avoid junk addresses and junk digital assets, we do not store all blockchain entities in the knowledge graph. The number of transactions or the maximum of cryptos transferred in one transaction related to an NFT or an address needs to surpass a threshold so that the NFT and the address will be added to the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph can also represent other types of entities, relationships, and properties. We develop a unified interface so that the expansion of the knowledge graph can be done in a logical, consistent, effective, scalable, and standardized manner. As the knowledge graph plays a crucial role, it can only be updated by a TRAVA.FINANCE’s validator, and this must be agreed upon by other validators on the network. The knowledge graph needs to be infinitely extended while the assigned number of TRAVA.FINANCEs is fixed and finite. Thus it is not possible to pay fees for updating the graph. However, there should also be a way to encourage validators to update and enrich the knowledge graph. To reconcile this contradiction, TRAVA.FINANCE requires and also encourages validators to update the knowledge graph. On the one hand, validators must update the knowledge graph regularly, otherwise, they will be stripped of their validator role, and cannot earn rewards for appending new blocks or verifying transactions. On the other hand, each time enriching the knowledge graph, validators will gain the fame score, thereby gaining more priorities and indirectly having the opportunity to earn more TRAVA.FINANCE coins when joining the network. Priorities may include voting power or the privilege to unlock TRAVA.FINANCE tokens earlier than the standard time when receiving awards. Enriching the graph is a special kind of TRAVA.FINANCE transaction that requires no fee. Out of all transactions, graph-related transactions are extracted and stored separately in files along with their hash value. This allows validators and other nodes to (re)construct the graph more efficiently with their own graph database systems.

And the first bidder will additionally be free from distributing his/her own 5% to other people. Note: The percentage that the later bidder pays for the earlier bidder is the same as the percentage that the sellers need to pay for the platform. So, 2.5% is also the amount auction publishers pay to the marketplace, which means that after receiving 97.5% of the final bidding price as income, sellers need to pay 2.5% of the income to the NFT marketplace. Therefore, the final payment rate that the sellers receive is 95.06% of the final bid. This fee is utilized for marketing, operating, and functioning. Seller (Auction Publishers) First Bidders Other Bidders Last Bidder Receive: ~95.06% of the final bidding price Receive: 100% of his/her bidding capital 2,5% of the later bidding price Receive: 2.5% of the later bidding price 97.5% of his/her bidding capital Pay: the final bidding price For example, First, Alice offered a 1000 TRAVA bid in a new auction. Secondly, Billy offered 1100 TRAVA ⇒ Alice would receive her own 1000 TRAVA and 2.5% of 1100 TRAVA, which would be 1027.5 TRAVA in total, and the extra 27.5 TRAVA is totally free money. Finally, Michael offered 1200 TRAVA. ⇒ Then, Billy would get 97.5% of his 1100 TRAVA and 2.5% of 1200 TRAVA, that is 1102.5 TRAVA, still getting 30 TRAVA for free. ⇒ The auction publisher will receive ~ 95.06% of the final bidding price (1200 TRAVA). Therefore, the seller will receive ~ 1140.72 TRAVA and pay 29.25 TRAVA to the platform. Steps to start an auction on Trava marketplace Step 1: Go to: https://nft-app.trava.finance/ Choose the Knight you want to sell in your NFT profile;  Step 2: Set a start price and end time Note that the time range for an auction is from 1 - 7 days.  Step 3: Confirm in your wallet, then the auction will start immediately. Once the auction is ended with bids, the seller or winning bidder needs to visit the Trava Knight auction tab and click the “Claim” button to finish the exchange transaction ']","[""Does Trava apply NFTs in the ecosystem? : Yes, TRAVA allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract. How does Trava price NFTs? : Trava will provide the auction function for NFT assets. Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way. We also avoid the price fluctuation of NFT because the NFTs have been priced in the auction contract before. What can I do with NFTs after the auction? : TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT. Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back. PreviousTrava Credit ScoreNextListing Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?"", 'NFT has become an increasingly popular way to buy and sell digital artwork. They are non-fungible, which naturally means that they are illiquid. Bringing liquidity to the NFT space would unlock a myriad of possibilities. As of May 2021, there have been no lending projects that make use of NFT as collaterals, because unlike a fungible currency or common stock, NFT value is difficult to determine. TRAVA.FINANCE adds more flexibility to the illiquid world of NFT and allows NFT owners to earn an ROI without selling it. TRAVA.FINANCE offers an innovative feature that prices NFTs based on auctions. After the auction, borrowers can use their NFTs as collateral. TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT. Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back. The auction process is as follows: 1. The NFT owner opens an auction session; she sets (i) the legal crypto used in the auction, (ii) the initial price for her NFT, (iii) the countdown time for the auction session, (iv) the mode for her auction (i.e., _auction-to-sell or auction-for-buy-right_), and other auction terms. 2. TRAVA.FINANCE users, who are interested in the NFT, can join in the auction session. To encourage users to participate in auctions, at the end of the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE randomly selects several bidders and rewards them with TRAVA tokens extracted from the auction fees. To guarantee that the bidders make their payment when they win the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE locks a number of their TRAVA tokens as soon as they join in the auction session and make a bid. When the auction finishes, they will immediately get their tokens back if they are not the winner. In case they are the winners, they can get their tokens back only if they pay for the auctioning NFT before the deadline. 3. In the _auction-to-sell_ mode, the auction winner will pay the owner the whole auction price to get the NFT. 4. In the _auction-for-buy-right_ mode, the auction winners have to pay a part of the auction price. We name the quotient of the amount the winners have to pay over the auction price ""_auction-paid ratio_ ”. The auction-paid ratio is calculated from the creditworthiness of the lender, borrower, NFT, and the auction terms. The NFT owners can use the cryptos paid by the auction winner as collateral for their loans. Once they repay their loan including the interest to the auction winners, they can get the NFT back. Otherwise, they will lose their NFT to the auction winners. These rules are all defined in the auction smart contract. TRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below. * **NFT owners** can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it. TRAVA.FINANCE thus increases the liquidity of NFTs and opens up a unique and exciting NFTFi marketplace. * Based on the given number of auction bids, **bidders** have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session. This rewarding mechanism provides incentives for users to actively make a bid in the auction. * **Auction winners** can get their desired NFT at a price lower than their bidding price (once NFT owners cannot repay the loan) or they can receive considerable interest from their loan to NFT owners (once NFT owners repay the loans and get their NFT back). * The credit scores of **NFT owners, auction winners, bidders,** and **NFTs** can be improved after auctions. The auction mechanism for NFT can also be applied to any type of digital asset. In our road map, TRAVA.FINANCE will implement this auction feature for various types of digital assets (e.g., stock token, smart contract).

What are benefit for those who participate in the Trava Knight auction?,0.9147,True,"['Benefit for those who participate in the Trava Knight auction Benefit for auction publishers (the sellers) Auction publishers (or sellers) are those who open auctions for their Knights. Opening an auction allows auction publishers to set up their price floor for their Knights, which determines their minimum desired price, helping them avoid selling their Knights at an unwanted low price compared to the market price. The auction opens a great opportunity for Knight owners to make profits without the need of disassembling their Knights to pieces and selling each item multiple times, which can cause wasted gas fees due to multiple transactions. Benefit for bidders Trava Knight auction is of benefit for bidders since it offers them the opportunity to get the full Knight, not every piece of armoury NFT on Trava NFT Marketplace. This helps bidders save more time in obtaining a Knight without finding and collecting armoury items to assemble. The auction also offers bidders an excellent method to get their favorable Knights, which suits their needs for missions such as Farming, Expedition, Farming with EXP and PvP tournaments in the future. Benefit for Trava Lending Pool The NFT Auction is the first step toward Trava Finance’s long-term aim of allowing NFTs to be used as collateral in the Trava Lending pool. By using an auction mechanism, the NFT will be priced and subsequently used as collateral in the Trava loan pool. This is a good method to vary the collaterals and give users more opportunities to lend assets.  ', 'Benefits of Knight NFTs Each of Knight and Armory NFTs represents a unique digital collectible that can be bought, sold, rented and put on auction on Trava Knight NFT Marketplace. It helps increase the utility of not only NFTs for NFT-collateralization, but also $TRAVA in our system as all the trading on the Marketplace is in $TRAVA. Users can assemble Knight NFTs to join Trava Farming Programs (NFT Farming, Heuristic Farming) in different vaults for a great APY — the rarer the NFT, the higher APY. The longer staked in the vaults, Loyal Knight NFT holders will also have more benefits in our lending pool in the future. In addition, you can get rewards from Trava Knight NFTs by playing the Battle Hand Mini-Game, and joining in Missions such as Expedition or Treasure Map.

If you need development support, join the Technical on Telegram. Last updated 3 years ago Was this helpful?', ""Does Trava apply NFTs in the ecosystem? : Yes, TRAVA allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract. How does Trava price NFTs? : Trava will provide the auction function for NFT assets. Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way. We also avoid the price fluctuation of NFT because the NFTs have been priced in the auction contract before. What can I do with NFTs after the auction? : TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT. Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.

Connect with TRAVA.FINANCE Editors:', 'Figure 1: Main features of TRAVA.FINANCE TRAVA.FINANCE (or TRAVA) is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrowing/lending interest rate, liquidity threshold, Loan to Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA.FINANCE offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA.FINANCE is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks. The pool owners, who are an additional role to lenders and borrowers, can receive more earnings by devising a good lending strategy for their pools. Moreover, to reduce risks and stimulate lending and borrowing, TRAVA.FINANCE performs cross-chain data analysis on multiple blockchain networks to (i) recommend optimal pool parameters for pool owners and (ii) detect unusual transactions in their pools. The lending marketplace model of TRAVA.FINANCE will increase crypto liquidity and promote the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. There are six salient features of TRAVA.FINANCE, including: * **Crypto lending marketplace** : TRAVA.FINANCE creates a **marketplace** in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and obtain greater earnings. * **Semantic knowledge graph** : TRAVA.FINANCE is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA.FINANCE to efficiently search for useful information such as (i) the amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses; (ii) the provenance of an NFT; (iii) aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc. * **Data analysis** : To reduce lending risks, TRAVA.FINANCE performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA.FINANCE recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, Loan to Value ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA.FINANCE also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools. * **Credit score evaluation** : Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can (i) reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool; and (ii) stimulate borrowing by defining a high Loan to Value ratio for borrowers with high credit scores. * **Cross-chain identification and cross-chain lending** : TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross- chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores. * **NFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals** : To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA.FINANCE allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn considerable amounts from the contract. NextArchitecture Last updated 1 year ago Was this helpful?', 'NFT has become an increasingly popular way to buy and sell digital artwork. They are non-fungible, which naturally means that they are illiquid. Bringing liquidity to the NFT space would unlock a myriad of possibilities. As of May 2021, there have been no lending projects that make use of NFT as collaterals, because unlike a fungible currency or common stock, NFT value is difficult to determine. TRAVA.FINANCE adds more flexibility to the illiquid world of NFT and allows NFT owners to earn an ROI without selling it. TRAVA.FINANCE offers an innovative feature that prices NFTs based on auctions. After the auction, borrowers can use their NFTs as collateral. TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT. Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back. The auction process is as follows: 1. The NFT owner opens an auction session; she sets (i) the legal crypto used in the auction, (ii) the initial price for her NFT, (iii) the countdown time for the auction session, (iv) the mode for her auction (i.e., _auction-to-sell or auction-for-buy-right_), and other auction terms. 2. TRAVA.FINANCE users, who are interested in the NFT, can join in the auction session. To encourage users to participate in auctions, at the end of the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE randomly selects several bidders and rewards them with TRAVA tokens extracted from the auction fees. To guarantee that the bidders make their payment when they win the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE locks a number of their TRAVA tokens as soon as they join in the auction session and make a bid. When the auction finishes, they will immediately get their tokens back if they are not the winner. In case they are the winners, they can get their tokens back only if they pay for the auctioning NFT before the deadline. 3. In the _auction-to-sell_ mode, the auction winner will pay the owner the whole auction price to get the NFT. 4. In the _auction-for-buy-right_ mode, the auction winners have to pay a part of the auction price. We name the quotient of the amount the winners have to pay over the auction price ""_auction-paid ratio_ ”. The auction-paid ratio is calculated from the creditworthiness of the lender, borrower, NFT, and the auction terms. The NFT owners can use the cryptos paid by the auction winner as collateral for their loans. Once they repay their loan including the interest to the auction winners, they can get the NFT back. Otherwise, they will lose their NFT to the auction winners. These rules are all defined in the auction smart contract. TRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below. * **NFT owners** can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it. TRAVA.FINANCE thus increases the liquidity of NFTs and opens up a unique and exciting NFTFi marketplace. * Based on the given number of auction bids, **bidders** have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session. This rewarding mechanism provides incentives for users to actively make a bid in the auction. * **Auction winners** can get their desired NFT at a price lower than their bidding price (once NFT owners cannot repay the loan) or they can receive considerable interest from their loan to NFT owners (once NFT owners repay the loans and get their NFT back). * The credit scores of **NFT owners, auction winners, bidders,** and **NFTs** can be improved after auctions. The auction mechanism for NFT can also be applied to any type of digital asset. In our road map, TRAVA.FINANCE will implement this auction feature for various types of digital assets (e.g., stock token, smart contract).

What is EXP points and how to earn them?,0.8277,False,"['EXP points At the moment, EXP (Experience Point) is the point that shows how long an Armoury NFT is staked in our vaults. EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault. Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault We’ve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items).

What are the features of Trava Finance?,0.8855,True,"['There are six salient features of TRAVA.FINANCE, including: Crypto lending marketplace: TRAVA.FINANCE creates a marketplace in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and obtain greater earnings. Semantic knowledge graph: TRAVA.FINANCE is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA.FINANCE to efficiently search for useful information such as (i) the amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses; (ii) the provenance of an NFT; (iii) aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc. Data analysis: To reduce lending risks, TRAVA.FINANCE performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA.FINANCE recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, Loan to Value ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA.FINANCE also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools. Credit score evaluation: Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can (i) reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool; and (ii) stimulate borrowing by defining a high Loan to Value ratio for borrowers with high credit scores. Cross-chain identification and cross-chain lending: TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross- chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores. NFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals: To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA.FINANCE allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn considerable amounts from the contract.

TRAVA.FINANCE is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks. The pool owners, who are an additional role to lenders and borrowers, can receive more earnings by devising a good lending strategy for their pools.

The former uses the protocols and the cross-chain knowledge graph provided by the latter so that end-users can interact with TRAVA.FINANCE marketplace and perform their lending functionalities. _TRAVA.FINANCE marketplace_ offers three lending roles for end-users. In other approaches, end-users can only participate in the lending business as either borrowers or lenders. In the TRAVA.FINANCE _marketplace_ , pool owners may play the additional role for them to start their own lending business and obtain greater earnings. To this end, they create and maintain their own lending pool. TRAVA.FINANCE performs blockchain data analysis to help them adapt optimal pool parameters to their lending strategy. In order for lenders, borrowers, and pool owners to perform lending business operations, TRAVA.FINANCE develops smart contracts divided into 5 groups: (1) Pool parameter optimization, (2) Cross-chain digital asset evaluation, (3) Credit score evaluation, (4) Digital asset (NFT, stoke token, etc.) auction-based pricing, and (5) Data analysis. These smart contracts are deployed on all nodes in the TRAVA.FINANCE network. To enable cross-chain lending, _TRAVA.FINANCE_ marketplace also includes “Cross-chain Digital Asset Management” smart contracts, which interact with users’ digital assets on multiple blockchain networks. The smart contracts allow TRAVA.FINANCE to query users’ balance, aggregate their cryptos, or lock their certain amount of cryptos. These cross-chain interactions require a network of validators to participate in to collect, confirm, and verify cross-chain data. TRAVA.FINANCE marketplace makes use of TRAVA.FINANCE foundation to communicate with other blockchain networks and implement the lending functionalities offered to end-users. TRAVA.FINANCE foundation is built on the hyper-linked datachain protocol. It uses three ToVChain's protocols, including (1) Data exchange protocol to enable interactions between TRAVA.FINANCE and other blockchain networks, (2) Data linking protocol to enrich the cross- chain knowledge graph with linked financial data collected from multiple chains, and (3) Cross- chain identification protocol to identify the same owner of multiple wallet addresses on single or multiple blockchain networks and thus facilitate fast and efficient mortgage placement. TRAVA.FINANCE foundation also uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to perform data analysis and evaluate users’ credit scores. The knowledge graph is presented in the next section. PreviousIntroductionNextCross-chain Knowledge Graph Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?"", 'Figure 4: Cross-chain identification: The cross-chain identification protocol plays an important role in the TRAVA.FINANCE architecture. It can be used to verify that multiple addresses on different chains belong to the same user. The protocol allows TRAVA.FINANCE to provide an overview of anonymous users, including their total cryptos and other digital assets, statistics for their transactions, and their relationships with other blockchain addresses. These types of information and relationships are stored on the cross-chain knowledge graph. The protocol can (i) improve the credit score of the users and their wallet address so that they can get favorable interest rates, (ii) save them transaction fees since they can use up all of their cryptos as collateral in a single transaction, and (iii) allow them to get their cryptos back when they lose one of their wallet address. To implement the protocol, we develop a wallet application so that users can manage their accounts and prove their ownership of multiple accounts. The application provides users with two functionalities: “Add account” and “Create a proof of ownership”. Users can add a new account to the wallet application in multiple ways, e.g., (i) create an account, (ii) import a private key, and (iii) connect to a hardware wallet. To foster their DeFi transactions, they might need to prove that they are the owner of n addresses. To this end, they can use our wallet application to perform a transaction that activates the cross-chain identification protocol. Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators check the accuracy of the data associated with the transaction. If the data is valid, the validators accept the transaction and write the sameAs relationship among the owners of the addresses to the knowledge graph. In the following we describe our processing to verify the cross-chain identification of multiple wallet addresses. User side: Assume that a user would like to confirm her ownership for 3 accounts, the wallet creates a message containing 3 data elements, each includes a pair of a chainId and a public key . Every element has a fixed size of 41 bytes: 8 bytes for the chainId and 33 bytes for the public key . The data format is as follows: * data1 (41 bytes) := chainId1 (8 bytes) + pub1 (33 bytes) * data2 (41 bytes) := chainId2 (8 bytes) + pub2 (33 bytes) * data3 (41 bytes) := chainId3 (8 bytes) + pub3 (33 bytes) The wallet uses the Merkle tree to hash the data and obtains the rootHash (32 bytes) * rootHash := MerkleTree([data1,data2,data3]).getRoot() The user then uses her 3 private keys to sign on the rootHash . Each signing creates a signature, named si (64 bytes): * s1 := Sign(rootHash, prv1) * s2 := Sign(rootHash, prv2) * s3 := Sign(rootHash, prv3) Finally, a transaction is generated and broadcasted to validators. A sample of transaction payload is as follows: * Type (8 bytes): ""SameAs"" * Number (4 bytes): 3 // The number of addresses * Message (n 41 bytes): data1 data2 data3 * Signatures (n 64 bytes): s1 s2 s3 * Timestamp (8 bytes): 1619602364 The total size of a transaction to prove n accounts of the same user is: 20 + n * 105 bytes Validator side: Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators verify the timestamp and then verify the signatures as follows. They first extract the message {data1, … datan} and the list of signatures {s1, … sn} . From each data element datai , the validators get the chainId and the public key (i.e., pubi ). They use the Merkle tree to hash the data and regenerate the rootHash : * rootHash := MerkleTree([data1, data2, data3]).getRoot() The validators then use pubi to verify signature si on the rootHash: * verifySignature(rootHash, s1 , pub1) => valid/invalid * verifySignature(rootHash, s2 , pub1) => valid/invalid * verifySignature(rootHash, s3 , pub1) => valid/invalid Once all signatures are valid, the validators agree that all accounts stored in the message belong to the same user. From n pairs of chainId and public key , the validators calculate the respective addresses of the user. To eliminate useless addresses, the validators perform additional checks on the age of the address, its average balance, or the total number of transactions related to the address. Finally, the validators store the sameAs relationship among the valid addresses of the user on the knowledge graph.

']","[""Figure 3: An example of the cross-chain knowledge graph The knowledge graph is one of the most fundamental components of TRAVA.FINANCE, which is responsible for storing and representing aggregated data from multiple blockchain networks. The graph and TRAVA.FINANCE protocols make independent blockchains interconnected and create the internet of hyper-linked blockchains, allowing DApps to address complex business in reality. Figure 3 shows an example of the knowledge graph. The circle represents an entity (or instance) of data such as a wallet address, a user, a lending pool, an NFT, or other types of digital assets. Each entity is associated with other entities in certain relationships, represented by directional arrows; the direction of an arrow is the direction of the relationship. The white rectangles are the values for the data attributes of the entity. The example graph shows that the WalletAddress2 is on the Ethereum network and that address owns an NFT. Aggregated information of the NFT, such as the highest bid price, number of auctions, list of addresses ever owned, etc., are also represented in the knowledge graph. Let us assume that a user creates one address on the Bitcoin network and one address on the Ethereum network. Because there were no relationships among these addresses, the knowledge graph creates two anonymous users, i.e., AnonymousUser1 and AnonymousUser2. AnonymousUser1 owns the Bitcoin addresses (i.e., WalletAddress3), and AnonymousUser2 has one Ethereum address, i.e., WalletAddress1. Various information related to a wallet address is stored in the graph. For example, the WalletAddress3 entity contains the _average balance_ , the _total amount of ETHs transferred in and out_ , the _total number of transactions_ , or _the average, median, mode,_ and _highest number of ETHs transferred in one transaction._ Assuming the user wants to increase his/her credit score or use up all of his/her cryptos as collateral for a loan, he or she can unify all addresses as one via the cross-chain identification protocol performed in only one TRAVA.FINANCE's transaction. After completing the transaction, the two anonymous users are linked by the _sameAs_ relationship. Depending on users’ needs, the cross-chain identification protocol also supports linking two wallet address entities by a _guarantee_ relationship. Once an address is lost, if all the addresses that guarantee the address confirm the loss, the address status will be claimed as _lost_ in the knowledge graph. Wallet addresses can also be connected by a _transfer_ relationship. To ensure scalability, rather than detailed transactions, statistical and aggregated information on transactions is calculated and stored in that _transfer_ relationship. As in the knowledge graph example above, several remarkable pieces of information are saved, including _BlockchainAddress1 has transferred 400 ETHs in total to BlockchainAddress2; it is performed through 10 transactions, and the largest transaction transfers 200 ETHs._ To avoid junk addresses and junk digital assets, we do not store all blockchain entities in the knowledge graph. The number of transactions or the maximum of cryptos transferred in one transaction related to an NFT or an address needs to surpass a threshold so that the NFT and the address will be added to the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph can also represent other types of entities, relationships, and properties. We develop a unified interface so that the expansion of the knowledge graph can be done in a logical, consistent, effective, scalable, and standardized manner. As the knowledge graph plays a crucial role, it can only be updated by a TRAVA.FINANCE’s validator, and this must be agreed upon by other validators on the network. The knowledge graph needs to be infinitely extended while the assigned number of TRAVA.FINANCEs is fixed and finite. Thus it is not possible to pay fees for updating the graph. However, there should also be a way to encourage validators to update and enrich the knowledge graph. To reconcile this contradiction, TRAVA.FINANCE requires and also encourages validators to update the knowledge graph. On the one hand, validators must update the knowledge graph regularly, otherwise, they will be stripped of their validator role, and cannot earn rewards for appending new blocks or verifying transactions. On the other hand, each time enriching the knowledge graph, validators will gain the fame score, thereby gaining more priorities and indirectly having the opportunity to earn more TRAVA.FINANCE coins when joining the network. Priorities may include voting power or the privilege to unlock TRAVA.FINANCE tokens earlier than the standard time when receiving awards. Enriching the graph is a special kind of TRAVA.FINANCE transaction that requires no fee. Out of all transactions, graph-related transactions are extracted and stored separately in files along with their hash value. This allows validators and other nodes to (re)construct the graph more efficiently with their own graph database systems.

PreviousTrava Pool Creation User GuideNextTrava Forum User Guide Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?', 'Where can I see my credit score? : Go to https://scoring.trava.finance/credit-score/orai and connect your wallet, you will see your credit score right on the screen. What is users’ credit score? : In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. What benefits does credit score brings to users? : -For borrowers, the primary benefit is that they can borrow with a ""preferential interest rate"" if their credit score is high. They can also receive higher loan-to-value-ratio compared to other users For lenders, who have high credit scores easily become LPs of different pools. Moreover, when they create a pool, their pool will have a higher credit score because the pool creator\'s credit score is also a criterion for the pool scoring. Especially, pool owners can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. How Credit scores for wallet addresses are calculated? : To evaluate credit scores for wallet addresses, TRAVA credit scoring model will take into account 5 factors: 1. Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address. 2. Transaction history: TRAVA aggregates all transactions of a wallet address across all platforms to calculate various parameters such as (i) transaction amount, (ii) number of liquidations, etc. 3. Loans ratio: represents the debt position of an account, including the Loan-to-balance ratio and Loan-to-investment ratio. 4. Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. 5. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range. The z-score is calculated from the mean and the standard deviation from every corresponding parameter of all accounts. To be more specific, you can read this function in TRAVA whitepaper. How the user\'s credit score will be updated? : Our system has both periodic updates and instant updates. The instant update occurs when users actively make transactions such as deposit, withdraw, repay... Or when users view their credit score on our app. In case a user has not viewed their credit score and had no transactions for a long time, their credit score is still updated periodically and automatically, which can be weekly or monthly. We are still trying to optimize it. Which objects does Trava evaluate credit score for? : At the moment, Trava has been evaluating the credit scores for 3 types of Objects: Wallet addresses (users), tokens, and NFTs. How to increase my credit score? : To improve the credit score of your wallet, you would need to take into account our five parameters, i.e., Total asset, Transaction history, Loans ratios, Circulating assets, and Trustworthiness of possessing assets. For instance, you should increase your wallet balance with prestige coins and tokens, perform more transactions and become more active in the crypto market, maintaining good Loan-to-balance and Loan-to-investment ratios, supply more liquidity to lending pools, trade on lending DApps to earn as much profit as you can, avoid collateral liquidation while borrowing, and possess at least $1000 valuable token (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, or BNB). Besides, you need to be credible users for a long time. It is because to avoid fraud, TRAVA calculates some credit score parameters based on their average values in the last k days, where k depends on the volatility of the crypto market. Moreover, some parameters are assessed based on the “standardized score” function, which calculates the mean and the standard deviation of all accounts’ parameters. Thus, trying to be the best at some criteria would improve your credit score too. Why did my credit score decrease? : The reasons why your credit score drops might be: You have bad transactions such as borrowing liquidations, your balance decrease, your borrowing rate is higher, you are not active enough, etc...You can read our white paper to understand how the credit score mechanism functions. https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/credit-score-evaluation PreviousTroubleshootingNextNFTs Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?', 'Figure 4: Cross-chain identification: The cross-chain identification protocol plays an important role in the TRAVA.FINANCE architecture. It can be used to verify that multiple addresses on different chains belong to the same user. The protocol allows TRAVA.FINANCE to provide an overview of anonymous users, including their total cryptos and other digital assets, statistics for their transactions, and their relationships with other blockchain addresses. These types of information and relationships are stored on the cross-chain knowledge graph. The protocol can (i) improve the credit score of the users and their wallet address so that they can get favorable interest rates, (ii) save them transaction fees since they can use up all of their cryptos as collateral in a single transaction, and (iii) allow them to get their cryptos back when they lose one of their wallet address. To implement the protocol, we develop a wallet application so that users can manage their accounts and prove their ownership of multiple accounts. The application provides users with two functionalities: “Add account” and “Create a proof of ownership”. Users can add a new account to the wallet application in multiple ways, e.g., (i) create an account, (ii) import a private key, and (iii) connect to a hardware wallet. To foster their DeFi transactions, they might need to prove that they are the owner of n addresses. To this end, they can use our wallet application to perform a transaction that activates the cross-chain identification protocol. Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators check the accuracy of the data associated with the transaction. If the data is valid, the validators accept the transaction and write the sameAs relationship among the owners of the addresses to the knowledge graph. In the following we describe our processing to verify the cross-chain identification of multiple wallet addresses. User side: Assume that a user would like to confirm her ownership for 3 accounts, the wallet creates a message containing 3 data elements, each includes a pair of a chainId and a public key . Every element has a fixed size of 41 bytes: 8 bytes for the chainId and 33 bytes for the public key . The data format is as follows: * data1 (41 bytes) := chainId1 (8 bytes) + pub1 (33 bytes) * data2 (41 bytes) := chainId2 (8 bytes) + pub2 (33 bytes) * data3 (41 bytes) := chainId3 (8 bytes) + pub3 (33 bytes) The wallet uses the Merkle tree to hash the data and obtains the rootHash (32 bytes) * rootHash := MerkleTree([data1,data2,data3]).getRoot() The user then uses her 3 private keys to sign on the rootHash . Each signing creates a signature, named si (64 bytes): * s1 := Sign(rootHash, prv1) * s2 := Sign(rootHash, prv2) * s3 := Sign(rootHash, prv3) Finally, a transaction is generated and broadcasted to validators. A sample of transaction payload is as follows: * Type (8 bytes): ""SameAs"" * Number (4 bytes): 3 // The number of addresses * Message (n 41 bytes): data1 data2 data3 * Signatures (n 64 bytes): s1 s2 s3 * Timestamp (8 bytes): 1619602364 The total size of a transaction to prove n accounts of the same user is: 20 + n * 105 bytes Validator side: Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators verify the timestamp and then verify the signatures as follows. They first extract the message {data1, … datan} and the list of signatures {s1, … sn} . From each data element datai , the validators get the chainId and the public key (i.e., pubi ). They use the Merkle tree to hash the data and regenerate the rootHash : * rootHash := MerkleTree([data1, data2, data3]).getRoot() The validators then use pubi to verify signature si on the rootHash: * verifySignature(rootHash, s1 , pub1) => valid/invalid * verifySignature(rootHash, s2 , pub1) => valid/invalid * verifySignature(rootHash, s3 , pub1) => valid/invalid Once all signatures are valid, the validators agree that all accounts stored in the message belong to the same user. From n pairs of chainId and public key , the validators calculate the respective addresses of the user. To eliminate useless addresses, the validators perform additional checks on the age of the address, its average balance, or the total number of transactions related to the address. Finally, the validators store the sameAs relationship among the valid addresses of the user on the knowledge graph.

You must have BSC in your wallet for the transaction fees, without it you won't be able to interact. Depending on the network status, the cost of the transactions may vary. How to do when the site does not load? : The following steps may solve your problems: * If you are using Google browser, switch to another browser to see if the issues are coming from the browser. If it is related to google browser some helpful actions are: * Clearing cache data and cookies for the site * Hard refresh with control + F5 (or cmd + r) * Disable brave wallet (or the wallet not being used as default, for example metamask, dapper, etc. )or other extensions that might be interfering with proper connection with the wallet * If the site still won't load after taking the steps above, you will have to use the platform in another browser. * Make sure your internet connection is working and stable * Restart the browser and try to connect again * Try to hard refresh the site with control + F5 * Check if there are any updates for your browser or wallet provider. If so, update it to the latest version. Pending confirmation is stuck: In this situation, you can get rid of the stuck transaction by speeding it up or cancelling it. Depending on the wallet you are using, you may have that option natively. Do not keep sending transactions, as every new transaction will be stuck pending the oldest transaction to be confirmed.

In it, we mentioned the need for a feature so that we can combine various actions in a single transaction — Smart Wallet. Utilizing Smart Wallet in Trava Station system However, many people may not understand their fundamental mechanisms and profound benefits, and that is why we have this article. Follow along with the content below to answer questions surrounding Smart Wallet, and clarify the importance of it in the Trava Station system. Unveiling the Smart Wallet At its core, a smart wallet is an advanced digital tool designed to enhance the way we store, manage, and interact with our financial assets. Each smart wallet is created and owned by the user, representing them (their proxy) and ensuring absolute control over its operations. Departing from the standard Web3 wallets, smart wallets eliminate the need for private keys or seed phrases, instead rely on smart contracts. These intricate computer programs run on a blockchain, operate based on predefined rules and conditions. Conditions and access permissions are encoded into these self-executing code, rendering Smart Wallet both secure and adaptable for managing financial resources. Smart Wallet and Trava Station When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create a Smart Wallet. To understand why, we must first look at the essence of Trava Station — a transit point for performing actions in one go. Normally, you will have to execute and pay a fee for separate transactions on blockchain, as you cannot perform another action if you have a pending one. In response to that, this upcoming product is intended to reduce both the time you spend switching between Trava platforms, and the fee of making multiple transactions. With Trava Station, your assets will be put into Smart Wallet to be evaluated according to the sequences of actions and parameters you set. It now acts as an intermediary so that the requests of the users can be calculated and fulfilled in one go, making the experience much smoother. While using Trava Station, your assets will be temporarily held in Smart Wallet, then returned to your Main Wallet (Metamask, Trust Wallet,…) after the process is over. Trava Station’s features with Smart Wallet: Our Smart Wallet can serve as a stay point of your assets when you perform some special actions in the Trava ecosystem. For example, when you create an action with Freight in Trava Station to sell Armoury items, the money won’t immediately go into your Smart Wallet. The NFT will stay there until someone buys it on the Marketplace, at which point the process ends and now your Smart Wallet will hold the money from that sale. Trava Station’s Smart Wallet allows users to create their own routes to execute actions within and between Trava Finance protocols efficiently, particularly with Freight. In addition, there are pre-made routes that you can import from Tramlines to freely use. Smart Wallet also supports storing pre-set rules for specific conditions, which best shows in Junction. This feature includes sequences that won’t run right when you create them, but will be triggered by the system bot when a condition is reached. You can also track all the assets in your Smart Wallet in the Portfolio section of Trava Station. This feature will display your position in the Lending Pool when you use Smart Wallet to perform actions in the pools in the Trava ecosystem. Or as with the example mentioned above — you create an order to sell Armoury items, Portfolio will display those NFTs for sale, and the amount of money you have in your Smart Wallet. Pervasive Benefits of Smart Wallets Smart Wallet is absolutely necessary for Trava Station to work. It provides a smoother DeFi experience by allowing users to combine several transactions into one, minimizing the fee of performing multiple actions at the same time, and so on. Smart Wallet brings more convenient experience while still offering enhanced security, satisfying not only new users but also experienced ones. Thanks to the versatility of smart contracts, it can break user reliance on private keys, offer advantageous new features and provide a better experience. In their development, Smart Wallets also presented a number of other uses, such as allowing multisig transactions, or extra layer of security through authenticating apps. They are also capable of limiting daily transaction amounts, reducing the possibility of costly errors and stopping attackers from emptying your wallet. These are all potential benefits of Smart Wallet that can be applied to Trava Station, which have been looked into and / or currently being developed by the Trava team. Conclusion Smart Wallet marks a pivotal juncture in our journey, offering heightened security and streamlined accessibility for Trava Station. We stand poised to significantly enhance your DeFi experience, formulating an effective ecosystem amidst this evolving landscape. With the release of this product, Trava Finance looks forward to bringing you the most convenience, minimizing costs and time for users’ transactions. 🌟So let’s countdown to Trava Station launch on August 24, 2023 .

What is veTRAVA?,0.9034,True,"['veTRAVA stands for voting escrow Trava. It is an ERC721 token that acts as evidence of your locking token in the governance module. Every time users create a new lock, they receive a veTRAVA token, storing their locked balance, unlock time, and rewards amount. The longer you lock your tokens, the more voting power you have (and the bigger incentive you can earn). For example, you can vote lock 1,000 TRAVA/rTRAVA for a year to have 250 voting power. Each token locked for four years is equal to 1 voting power. The number of voting power you will receive depends on your locked balance & unlock time.  The minimum locking time is one week, and the maximum locking time is four years. Your voting power gradually decreases as your escrow tokens approach their lock expiry.

After the Trava Lottery and Battlehand, the next game — Fortune Mining, will be soon published on September 8th 2022. Introduction to fortune mining What is Fortune Mining? As mentioned, this is an important component of the Trava Minigame Series. The game is built on the well-known blockchain idea of the No-loss-rewards game, allowing participants to earn big prizes without worrying about losing their money. How does it work? So how exactly does Fortune Mining work? For more details, users first need to deposit their money into the Fortune Mining Pool. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm). That means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones. The benefit Fortune Mining brings to players. _No loss to worry about_: As the old saying goes, “More risk brings higher return.” However, with Fortune Mining, players will not need to worry about their losses. Because of the unique mechanism, there will be no loss, and unlucky players can get their deposits back after a certain period. _Big prize to look for_: While there is no loss to be concerned about, the winner may earn significantly more benefits than they would if they had deposited into the regular pool. For example , assuming that we run a Fortune Mining pool for users to deposit DAI and gain 20.000 DAI in total deposited after one week. With APY at 1.5% (that is converted to APR at about 0,92%) and APR at 4.08%, respectively, two weeks later, the total reward for the winner will be calculated as: _20000 (0.92%+ 4.08%)/365 14 = 38.356 DAI._ That means if you deposit 100 DAI at first and become the lucky one, you will receive about $38,356 (the interest rate at about 1000%) instead of $0,19 (the interest rate at about 5%). As in the example above, the gap between the rewards you could get in a normal pool and the Fortune Mining pool is very significant. For that reason, this mini-game will be a good choice for those with small capital to try their luck and get much more money than usual. To sum up, what do you need to do to attain the benefits? Step 1. Deposit your token into the Fortune Mining Pool Step 2. Waiting for a certain period (depending on each campaign) Step 3 . Check the result: * If you are the lucky one: Congratulations, you get all the rewards from the pool * If you have not been lucky yet, don’t worry, you can withdraw your deposit or keep them in the pool, then try your luck in the next period. Notes: We will soon run a voting snapshot for our community to decide which asset should be put in the Fortune Mining pool. Stay tuned for that.

After the Trava Lottery and Battlehand, the next game — Fortune Mining, will be soon published on September 8th 2022. Introduction to fortune mining What is Fortune Mining? As mentioned, this is an important component of the Trava Minigame Series. The game is built on the well-known blockchain idea of the No-loss-rewards game, allowing participants to earn big prizes without worrying about losing their money. How does it work? So how exactly does Fortune Mining work? For more details, users first need to deposit their money into the Fortune Mining Pool. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm). That means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones. The benefit Fortune Mining brings to players. _No loss to worry about_: As the old saying goes, “More risk brings higher return.” However, with Fortune Mining, players will not need to worry about their losses. Because of the unique mechanism, there will be no loss, and unlucky players can get their deposits back after a certain period. _Big prize to look for_: While there is no loss to be concerned about, the winner may earn significantly more benefits than they would if they had deposited into the regular pool. For example , assuming that we run a Fortune Mining pool for users to deposit DAI and gain 20.000 DAI in total deposited after one week. With APY at 1.5% (that is converted to APR at about 0,92%) and APR at 4.08%, respectively, two weeks later, the total reward for the winner will be calculated as: _20000 (0.92%+ 4.08%)/365 14 = 38.356 DAI._ That means if you deposit 100 DAI at first and become the lucky one, you will receive about $38,356 (the interest rate at about 1000%) instead of $0,19 (the interest rate at about 5%). As in the example above, the gap between the rewards you could get in a normal pool and the Fortune Mining pool is very significant. For that reason, this mini-game will be a good choice for those with small capital to try their luck and get much more money than usual. To sum up, what do you need to do to attain the benefits? Step 1. Deposit your token into the Fortune Mining Pool Step 2. Waiting for a certain period (depending on each campaign) Step 3 . Check the result: * If you are the lucky one: Congratulations, you get all the rewards from the pool * If you have not been lucky yet, don’t worry, you can withdraw your deposit or keep them in the pool, then try your luck in the next period. Notes: We will soon run a voting snapshot for our community to decide which asset should be put in the Fortune Mining pool. Stay tuned for that.

After the Trava Lottery and Battlehand, the next game — Fortune Mining, will be soon published on September 8th 2022. Introduction to fortune mining What is Fortune Mining? As mentioned, this is an important component of the Trava Minigame Series. The game is built on the well-known blockchain idea of the No-loss-rewards game, allowing participants to earn big prizes without worrying about losing their money. How does it work? So how exactly does Fortune Mining work? For more details, users first need to deposit their money into the Fortune Mining Pool. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm). That means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones. The benefit Fortune Mining brings to players. _No loss to worry about_: As the old saying goes, “More risk brings higher return.” However, with Fortune Mining, players will not need to worry about their losses. Because of the unique mechanism, there will be no loss, and unlucky players can get their deposits back after a certain period. _Big prize to look for_: While there is no loss to be concerned about, the winner may earn significantly more benefits than they would if they had deposited into the regular pool. For example , assuming that we run a Fortune Mining pool for users to deposit DAI and gain 20.000 DAI in total deposited after one week. With APY at 1.5% (that is converted to APR at about 0,92%) and APR at 4.08%, respectively, two weeks later, the total reward for the winner will be calculated as: _20000 (0.92%+ 4.08%)/365 14 = 38.356 DAI._ That means if you deposit 100 DAI at first and become the lucky one, you will receive about $38,356 (the interest rate at about 1000%) instead of $0,19 (the interest rate at about 5%). As in the example above, the gap between the rewards you could get in a normal pool and the Fortune Mining pool is very significant. For that reason, this mini-game will be a good choice for those with small capital to try their luck and get much more money than usual. To sum up, what do you need to do to attain the benefits? Step 1. Deposit your token into the Fortune Mining Pool Step 2. Waiting for a certain period (depending on each campaign) Step 3 . Check the result: * If you are the lucky one: Congratulations, you get all the rewards from the pool * If you have not been lucky yet, don’t worry, you can withdraw your deposit or keep them in the pool, then try your luck in the next period. Notes: We will soon run a voting snapshot for our community to decide which asset should be put in the Fortune Mining pool. Stay tuned for that.

']","['Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information). :', 'Utilizing Smart Wallet in Trava Station system: Embracing the future: Published in 4 min readAug 19, 2023 Share As reported in the recent topic about Trava Station in the Forum, we have introduced you to some information about this new product. In it, we mentioned the need for a feature so that we can combine various actions in a single transaction — Smart Wallet. Utilizing Smart Wallet in Trava Station system However, many people may not understand their fundamental mechanisms and profound benefits, and that is why we have this article. Follow along with the content below to answer questions surrounding Smart Wallet, and clarify the importance of it in the Trava Station system. Unveiling the Smart Wallet At its core, a smart wallet is an advanced digital tool designed to enhance the way we store, manage, and interact with our financial assets. Each smart wallet is created and owned by the user, representing them (their proxy) and ensuring absolute control over its operations. Departing from the standard Web3 wallets, smart wallets eliminate the need for private keys or seed phrases, instead rely on smart contracts. These intricate computer programs run on a blockchain, operate based on predefined rules and conditions. Conditions and access permissions are encoded into these self-executing code, rendering Smart Wallet both secure and adaptable for managing financial resources. Smart Wallet and Trava Station When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create a Smart Wallet. To understand why, we must first look at the essence of Trava Station — a transit point for performing actions in one go. Normally, you will have to execute and pay a fee for separate transactions on blockchain, as you cannot perform another action if you have a pending one. In response to that, this upcoming product is intended to reduce both the time you spend switching between Trava platforms, and the fee of making multiple transactions. With Trava Station, your assets will be put into Smart Wallet to be evaluated according to the sequences of actions and parameters you set. It now acts as an intermediary so that the requests of the users can be calculated and fulfilled in one go, making the experience much smoother. While using Trava Station, your assets will be temporarily held in Smart Wallet, then returned to your Main Wallet (Metamask, Trust Wallet,…) after the process is over. Trava Station’s features with Smart Wallet: Our Smart Wallet can serve as a stay point of your assets when you perform some special actions in the Trava ecosystem. For example, when you create an action with Freight in Trava Station to sell Armoury items, the money won’t immediately go into your Smart Wallet. The NFT will stay there until someone buys it on the Marketplace, at which point the process ends and now your Smart Wallet will hold the money from that sale. Trava Station’s Smart Wallet allows users to create their own routes to execute actions within and between Trava Finance protocols efficiently, particularly with Freight. In addition, there are pre-made routes that you can import from Tramlines to freely use. Smart Wallet also supports storing pre-set rules for specific conditions, which best shows in Junction. This feature includes sequences that won’t run right when you create them, but will be triggered by the system bot when a condition is reached. You can also track all the assets in your Smart Wallet in the Portfolio section of Trava Station. This feature will display your position in the Lending Pool when you use Smart Wallet to perform actions in the pools in the Trava ecosystem. Or as with the example mentioned above — you create an order to sell Armoury items, Portfolio will display those NFTs for sale, and the amount of money you have in your Smart Wallet. Pervasive Benefits of Smart Wallets Smart Wallet is absolutely necessary for Trava Station to work. It provides a smoother DeFi experience by allowing users to combine several transactions into one, minimizing the fee of performing multiple actions at the same time, and so on. Smart Wallet brings more convenient experience while still offering enhanced security, satisfying not only new users but also experienced ones. Thanks to the versatility of smart contracts, it can break user reliance on private keys, offer advantageous new features and provide a better experience. In their development, Smart Wallets also presented a number of other uses, such as allowing multisig transactions, or extra layer of security through authenticating apps. They are also capable of limiting daily transaction amounts, reducing the possibility of costly errors and stopping attackers from emptying your wallet. These are all potential benefits of Smart Wallet that can be applied to Trava Station, which have been looked into and / or currently being developed by the Trava team. Conclusion Smart Wallet marks a pivotal juncture in our journey, offering heightened security and streamlined accessibility for Trava Station. We stand poised to significantly enhance your DeFi experience, formulating an effective ecosystem amidst this evolving landscape. With the release of this product, Trava Finance looks forward to bringing you the most convenience, minimizing costs and time for users’ transactions. 🌟So let’s countdown to Trava Station launch on August 24, 2023 .

How much should I keep my health factor at to avoid liquidation penalty?,0.904,True,"['How to avoid being liquidated?  In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2.']","[""Introduction: In borrowing, when a borrowers’ health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value, a liquidation process might happen. In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty? : The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated? : In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2. PreviousTesting TravaNextTroubleshooting Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?"", 'Is Borrowing assets more beneficial than Selling? : If you sell your assets, you will lose the possession of this particular asset. It means you would be no longer entitled to the potential upside value gain. Whereas, by borrowing, you can still obtain these potential earnings (working capital) without losing your asset. You can borrow when unexpected expenses happen and leverage your holding assets for other investment opportunities. How to borrow? : In order to borrow, you need to deposit any asset to be used as collateral first (check out the Depositing & Earning FAQ section for more info). After depositing, you simply go to the “Borrow” section and click the “Borrow” button on the asset you want to borrow. Input the amount and approve the transaction. The borrowed amount is based on the available deposits that you used as collateral. What is the maximum amount can I borrow? : The maximum amount you can borrow depends on your deposited value and the available liquidity. Please notice the health factor and liquidation threshold indicators to guarantee your collaterals are in the state of safety. Besides, you can not borrow if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor is too low. What type of asset do I repay my loans? : When repaying a loan, the type of asset that you need to repay is in the same asset you borrowed. For example, if you borrow 1 BNB you will pay back 1 BNB plus interest accrued. Another way to pay back the loan is using your collateral. If you want to pay back the loan based on USD price you can borrow any of the available stable coins as USDC, DAI, USDT, etc. How much interest would I pay for my loans? : When borrowing, the interest rate you need to pay depends on the borrowing rate which is determined from the supply and demand ratio of the asset. Moreover, the interest rate is a variable rate so that it changes constantly. The current borrowing rate of your borrowed assets is shown in the Borrowing section of your dashboard, you can check it any time. What is Health factor? : Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation? : The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals. When do I need to repay the loan? : As long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan. However, the accrued interest of your borrowing will grow day by day, making your health factor decrease. When it reaches the threshold of liquidation, your deposited assets are more likely to fall into liquidation status. How to repay the loan? : In order to pay back the loan you go to the Borrowings section of your dashboard and click on the repay button for the asset you borrowed and want to repay. Select the amount to pay back and approve the transaction. PreviousStaking/Depositing & EarningNextTesting Trava Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?', ""Loan To Value: The maximum amount that can be borrowed for a specific mortgage is determined by the Loan To Value (LTV) ratio. For example, if the LTV is 75%, borrowers will be allowed to borrow 0.75 ETH worth of corresponding currency for every 1 ETH worth of collateral. For a wallet, the maximum LTV is calculated as the weighted average of LTVs of collateral assets and their value. In particular, for a wallet that deposits the collateral assets that are worth in dollars ,…,C_1, \\dots ,C_n,…,, and their LTVs corresponding to LT,…,LTLTV_1, \\dots , LTV_nLT,…,LT, maximum LTV is ×LT+⋯+×LT+⋯+\\frac{C_1 \\times LTV_1 + \\cdots + C_n \\times LTV_n }{C_1+\\cdots+C_n}+⋯+×LT+⋯+×LT\u200b Liquidation Threshold: The liquidation threshold is the percentage at which a position is defined as undercollateralised. For example, a Liquidation threshold of 80% means that if the value rises above 80% of the collateral, the position is undercollateralised and could be liquidated. The difference between the Loan To Value and the Liquidation Threshold is a safety cushion for borrowers. For each wallet, the liquidation threshold is calculated as the weighted average of the liquidation thresholds of the collateral assets and their value. In particular, for a wallet that deposits the collateral assets that are worth in dollars ,…,C_1, \\dots ,C_n,…,, and their liquidation threshold, respectively, L,…,LLT_1, \\dots, LT_nL,…,L , the liquidation thresholds of wallet is ×L+⋯+×L+⋯+\\frac{C_1 \\times LT_1 + \\cdots + C_n \\times LT_n}{C_1 + \\cdots + C_n}+⋯+×L+⋯+×L\u200b Health Factor: For a wallet, these risk parameters enable the calculation of the health factor: =×L+⋯+×LBH_f = \\frac{C_1 \\times LT_1+ \\cdots + C_n \\times LT_n}{B}×L+⋯+×L\u200b where is total borrows (in dollars) , ,…,C_1,\\dots,C_n,…,is the values (in dollars) of collateral assets, and L,…,LLT_1, \\dots, LT_nL,…,L is their liquidation threshold, respectively. When 1H_f < 1 the loan may be liquidated to maintain solvency. Liquidation penalty: Liquidation penalty is a bonus applied to the price of collateral assets purchased by liquidators as part of the liquidation of a loan that has reached the liquidation threshold.

List of tokens supported by TRAVA: In the near future, we are going to support more tokens to optimize users experience and help them master their lending business! PreviousTrava Pool Creation User GuideNextTrava Forum User Guide Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?', 'Trava Pool Creation Components: In the Trava Multi-pool Ecosystem, there are three main components: - Pool Owners : Who create and manage their own lending pools. - Users : who use lending services (of Trava lending pool and user-owned lending pools) such as borrowing, depositing, etc. - Trava Governance : Who plays the significant roles in the decision-making process while running the ecosystem. Each of these components has its own roles and responsibilities that are shown in the infographic below: As shown on the infographic, while pool owners can freely add new tokens (set risk parameters included) or set reserve conditions, they need to assist Governance’s opinion if wanting to make changes after that. User Guide for Pool Owners: This documentation provides you with a thorough guideline for creating and managing pools with Trava Pool Creation. : How to create a pool Step 1. Accessing Trava Finance App: Accessing Trava Finance App. Connect and authorize your wallet. In the tab Market on the left menu, click on “Pool creation”. Step 2.

Explain in details Trava governace v1 and the vision for version 2,0.8516,True,"['Governance v1  For version 1 of Trava Governance, we present evolution in governance processes with on-chain features enabled. Governance Process  The governance process consists of 2 continuous processes: off-chain & on-chain.      Off-chain process:  In the off-chain process, anyone in the Trava community can raise their opinions and discuss ideas of how the protocol can improve by creating TRC - Trava Request for Comments on the Trava Forum.  After an idea is well-formed, a community member can follow our template for TIP - Trava Improvement Proposal and post on the forum for details feedback. We recommend off-chain voting (powered by snapshot.org) to gain exposure and rough consensus from the community to increase the chance of succeeding in the on-chain process.  When a TIP gets to its final version, the DAO Committee is in charge of the review process and officially proposes on-chain.      On-chain process:  When a TIP is proposed on-chain, it becomes transparent on the public blockchain; anyone possessing voting power can directly vote for or against this proposal.  After the voting period, a TIP will be queued and executed by the public.  The Security Advisory Board acts as a guardian to prevent malicious actions and security exploits in this process. Governance Authority  In governance version 1, the DAO will have authority over the Trava lending protocol. The community will have to agree on any significant changes or updates through the on-chain process. Governance Power  To gain governance power, holders need to lock their Trava or rTrava token in exchange for the veTRAVA token, which holds voting power. This vote locking mechanism encourages users who show a solid commitment to the protocol with more governance power and incentive.', 'In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1  In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc.  In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including:      Discussion: In this stage, Trava holders will discuss different problems on the Trava Forum.     Proposal: On this forum, once a person brings his or her ideas to the platform, the community will determine whether they should be considered by up-voting this proposal. If the community approves, it will be brought on the snapshot in the next step.     Voting off-chain on the snapshot: On the snapshot, users will vote for the proposition they want.     Voting on-chain: After the voting on the snapshot, the whole governance process will then be generated totally on-chain.     Execution: After the stage of making the decision, there are two scenarios. If the proposal is accepted, it will be executed; otherwise, it will be canceled.  In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: the amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time.  Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features:      Democracy: The voting enforcement process is democratic and transparent.     Connectivity: The community members can recommend, discuss, and manage the products and the development direction of the Trava Ecosystem.     Up-to-date: The community members can recommend the latest technologies and features based on the market trend that help the whole system make changes to the protocol for the best result.  The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2  Trava is the first one that allows users to create and manage their own lending pool. In the future, governance will play a significant role in the initialization movements and their operation in the future.  In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process.  Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.']","['Register **Registration Error** × Looks like your connection to Trava Forum was lost, please wait while we try to reconnect.', 'Login × **Login Unsuccessful** × Looks like your connection to Trava Forum was lost, please wait while we try to reconnect.', '1.

Is veTRAVA a NFT and how can I get it?,0.8695,True,"['How can I get veTRAVA?

Buying veTRAVA  Step 1: Just click on any sale slot:  Step 2: You will be directed to this page, click the “Buy” button:  Step 3: Confirm the money in the transaction and wait for it to be done:', 'What is veTRAVA?  To fulfill the “decentralized” part of the Trava Decentralized Marketplace, we launched Trava Governance, based on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model, to give users decision-making power. In this case, veTRAVA, in the form of NFT, represents this power and is determined by the time and amount of locked tokens (as they show your commitment toward the future of Trava Finance).  With the implementation of the Trava Governance Vault, users can lock their TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB into this vault to receive a certain amount of veTRAVA representing their powers: the more veTRAVA you own, the higher your voting power in the Trava ecosystem. The Benefits Of Owning veTRAVA  The key value of veTRAVA is its representative of users’ power and their commitment to the project. As a result, in the long term, users who own veTRAVA can receive significant benefits:      Deciding on crucial parameters such as LTV, risk parameters, etc., in the lending pools (Trava Lending Pool and Users-owned Pools).     Receiving share profit coming from the fee charged by borrowers     Receiving boosting rewards in rTRAVA by providing liquidity and holding veTRAVA at the same time.     Earning TRAVA reward: the APR will be revealed soon.  As mentioned, veTRAVA is utilized as a form of NFT. For now, it can only be available for those who lock their token into the Governance Vault. However, it will be exchanged peer-to-peer with the launch of veTRAVA Marketplace. veTRAVA Marketplace: Overview  As its name suggests, the veTRAVA marketplace is for users to buy and sell their veTRAVA. It means they can freely exchange their voting power. The main reason we came up with this idea is to optimize users’ experience, bringing them as much freedom as possible. It’s the “Decentralization” we are heading for.  Besides bringing more freedom to users, veTRAVA Marketplace increases liquidity for veTRAVA and thus benefits both sellers and buyers. In more detail, buyers can buy veTRAVA (voting power) easily on Marketplace and then earn voting power immediately. In this case, the remaining locking time will be more flexible, no longer limited to a particular period set in the Governance Vault. When it comes to sellers, they can easily utilize crypto assets in a more liberal way and get benefits from it. The Influences of veTRAVA Marketplace  veTRAVA Marketplace is an important feature that contributes to the development of Trava Governance. As mentioned above, users who hold many veTRAVA will have a crucial role in the decision-making process of the Trava Finance ecosystem. The veTRAVA holders can alternate the voting results, and through the Marketplace, users can buy or sell the voting power with others.  With the fact that users can trade their voting power to each other, anyone in the ecosystem will have a chance to vote for the changes they want to make in Trava Finance. The more users have veTRAVA, the more voting power is distributed, and users will be given the full power to make the decisions that can affect the Decentralized Lending Marketplace, which will elevate the decentralized side of Trava Finance’s ultimate goal.']","['Lock your tokens for veTRAVA: : Lock Calculator Select the token you want to lock, input lock amount, and select unlock time to see how many voting power you will have. : Create new veTRAVA lock 1.

What is health factor and how is it calculated exactly?,0.9011,True,"['What is Health factor?  Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation?  The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals.', 'Health Factor  For a wallet, these risk parameters enable the calculation of the health factor: Hf=C1×LT1+⋯+Cn×LTnB Hf\u200b=BC1\u200b×LT1\u200b+⋯+Cn\u200b×LTn\u200b\u200b  where  BB is total borrows (in dollars), C1,…,CnC1\u200b,…,Cn\u200b is  the values (in dollars) of collateral assets, and LT1,…,LTnLT1\u200b,…,LTn\u200b is their liquidation threshold, respectively. When Hf<1Hf\u200b<1 the loan may be liquidated to maintain solvency.']","[""Introduction: In borrowing, when a borrowers’ health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value, a liquidation process might happen. In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty? : The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated? : In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2.

Topics Topics created by Henry This user hasn't posted any topics yet. × Looks like your connection to Trava Forum was lost, please wait while we try to reconnect."", 'Is Borrowing assets more beneficial than Selling? : If you sell your assets, you will lose the possession of this particular asset. It means you would be no longer entitled to the potential upside value gain. Whereas, by borrowing, you can still obtain these potential earnings (working capital) without losing your asset. You can borrow when unexpected expenses happen and leverage your holding assets for other investment opportunities. How to borrow? : In order to borrow, you need to deposit any asset to be used as collateral first (check out the Depositing & Earning FAQ section for more info). After depositing, you simply go to the “Borrow” section and click the “Borrow” button on the asset you want to borrow. Input the amount and approve the transaction. The borrowed amount is based on the available deposits that you used as collateral. What is the maximum amount can I borrow? : The maximum amount you can borrow depends on your deposited value and the available liquidity. Please notice the health factor and liquidation threshold indicators to guarantee your collaterals are in the state of safety. Besides, you can not borrow if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor is too low. What type of asset do I repay my loans? : When repaying a loan, the type of asset that you need to repay is in the same asset you borrowed. For example, if you borrow 1 BNB you will pay back 1 BNB plus interest accrued. Another way to pay back the loan is using your collateral. If you want to pay back the loan based on USD price you can borrow any of the available stable coins as USDC, DAI, USDT, etc. How much interest would I pay for my loans? : When borrowing, the interest rate you need to pay depends on the borrowing rate which is determined from the supply and demand ratio of the asset. Moreover, the interest rate is a variable rate so that it changes constantly. The current borrowing rate of your borrowed assets is shown in the Borrowing section of your dashboard, you can check it any time. What is Health factor? : Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation? : The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals. When do I need to repay the loan? : As long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan. However, the accrued interest of your borrowing will grow day by day, making your health factor decrease. When it reaches the threshold of liquidation, your deposited assets are more likely to fall into liquidation status. How to repay the loan? : In order to pay back the loan you go to the Borrowings section of your dashboard and click on the repay button for the asset you borrowed and want to repay. Select the amount to pay back and approve the transaction.

I want to know the details of TRAVA's audit across all auditor platforms.,0.8161,False,"['Audit completion by Certik Audit Scope  The audit focused on the following considerations:      Testing the smart contracts against both common and uncommon attack vectors.      Assessing the codebase to ensure compliance with current best practices and industry standards.      Ensuring contract logic meets the specifications and intentions of the client.      Cross-referencing contract structure and implementation against similar smart contracts produced by industry leaders.      Thorough line-by-line manual review of the entire codebase by industry experts  Findings:  There are seven issues found in total, including 1 Minor Finding, 2 Informational Findings, and 4 Major Findings.  Firstly, one Minor and Two Informational Issues concern some coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused functions, missing zero addresses checking, and function type. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.  Secondly, all four Major Issues are related to Centralization. The owners of the following contracts below can execute some functions without obtaining the consensus of the community:      FactoryRegistry,      AddressesProviderFactory      PoolUpdateControl      LendingPoolConfigurator   Certik Recommendations for the Centralization Issue:  Certik advised to carefully manage the governance/guardian account’s private key to avoid any potential risks of being hacked. In general, Certik strongly recommended centralized privileges or roles in the protocol to be improved via a decentralized mechanism or via smart-contract-based accounts with enhanced security practices, e.g. Multisignature wallets.  Some feasible solutions recommended by Certik that would also mitigate the potential risk include:      Time-lock with reasonable latency, i.e. 48 hours, for awareness on privileged operations;      Assignment of privileged roles to multi-signature wallets to prevent a single point of failure due to the private key;      Introduction of a DAO/governance/voting module to increase transparency and user involvement.  Trava Solutions for the Centralization Issue  Trava has partially resolved these issues via smart-contract-based accounts. In particular:      Deploy a Multi-Signature wallet in BSC mainnet at the address:   0xdF73aC573Dfd430f4C5558B8CbeD86e86145501B      Set up the owner of the contracts and governance to the multi-signature wallet.  Although these issues are major, our approach can avoid the potential risks of centralization. Moreover, in our roadmap, we will enable DAO Functionalities in Q2–2022. The introduction of the DAO module will completely resolve the centralization issues. This approach will make our community control the process and activity of Trava Finance in the near future.', 'Audit completion by Hacken  This thorough security audit checked and ensured the following imperative points as 2 main Categories (1) Code review (2) Functional.  The audit report contains all found security vulnerabilities and other issues in the reviewed code. As a result of the audit, There are no critical issues in our contracts. Besides, Hacken’s security engineers found 4 high, 4 medium, and 3 low severity issues. Overall, after the auditing process, Hacken evaluated Trava’s contracts as Well-Secured (the highest level of security as the assessment). Severity High  There is one issue regarding the implementation function and three issues regarding uninitialized state variables:      Issue 1 (unimplemented function): The logic of function finalizeTranfer has commented-out unimplemented logic. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.      Issues 2, 3, 4 (uninitialized state variables): Some state variables are not initialized for the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager but they are being called.          Trava’s Response: We consider the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager as a Logic Contract where we execute our code by using delegate call from LendingPool Contract. That explains why we don’t initialize the state for that variable.          Following the verification, Hacken determined that these are not issues.  Severity Medium  There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused imports, Not checked contract address, and No event on lendingPoolConfigurator change. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.  There is one Issue concerning Possible FlashLoan attack in the LendingPool contract. Despite the fact that we do not believe this attack could happen in real life, we took great care in resolving the problem.  Description: IF both of TToken and its underlyingAsset are traded on multiple DEXes and have different rates there could be a FlashLoan attack. Attackers could FlashLoan a TToken, and process withdraw, which will give then the exact same amount of the underlyingAsset, and then calling deposit, they will receive the same amount of TToken.  Having the 1-to-1 “exchange” on the LendingPool and different rates on DEXes, attackers could “play” with the market many times in one transaction until they receive enough rewards. The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.  The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.  Hacken’s Recommendation: Consider some restrictions like minting/returning assets in the next block only.  Trava’s solution: Token transfer restrictions for transferring in the same block where minting occurred.  After the verification, Hacken concluded that the issue had been resolved completely. Severity Low  There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to Unused state variable, public/external function, Unused function argument. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.']","['Register **Registration Error** × Looks like your connection to Trava Forum was lost, please wait while we try to reconnect.', 'Login × **Login Unsuccessful** × Looks like your connection to Trava Forum was lost, please wait while we try to reconnect.', 'TRAVA.FINANCE (or TRAVA) is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending.

Explain EXP and how can I use it for Farming,0.998,True,"['At the moment, EXP (Experience Point) is the point that shows how long an Armoury NFT is staked in our vaults. EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault.  Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault  We’ve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items).  You can see your EXP  either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace.  Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs. However, when you withdraw your Knight NFT, disassemble and reassemble with different items to get another Knight NFT, your Armoury NFTs will have different EXPs.  For example: You open 4 chests and get: Helmet, Shield, Armour and Weapon. You assemble them into a Knight NFT and farm in our vault. After 24h, the EXPs for Armoury NFTs are as follow:      Weapon EXP: 86400      Shield EXP: 86400      Armor EXP: 86400      Helmet EXP: 86400  So EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400 (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400  After 24h, you withdraw your Knight NFT to reassemble with Armoury NFTs you buy on Trava NFT Marketplace. Suppose, those Armoury NFTs you bought have been already farmed in vault before and have the EXPs as follow:      Weapon EXP: 86400      Shield EXP: 100000      Armor EXP: 320000      Helmet EXP: 210000  Thus, the EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100 (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100  There will be a lot of benefits for NFT owners to have high EXPs. The more EXP you have, the more value the NFT will be. This can help you to distinguish NFT value from other NFTs of the same type and rarity. Moreover, the EXP will be applied in our Trade-up Mechanism which will be launched soon. In the future, EXP will be used with Credit Score and applied to NFT-collateralization. It can be said that EXP is an important factor in Trava Knight NFT to reach our goal of collateralization.', 'Heuristic Farming (Farming based on EXP)  When the new Farming mechanism commences, our 5 current Farming vaults will stop distributing TRAVA as reward, which means our 5 existing vaults will only give back EXP (one EXP for each second in 5 current farming vaults). This change supports NFT owners to gain EXP to enter Heuristic Farming with better rewards.  In the new Farming mechanism, we provide  5 more vaults for Heuristic Farming, and you can deposit as many knights as you want into each Vault, provided that those knights have the same rarity as that Vault. Rewards from Heuristic Farming are rTRAVA tokens and EXP (one EXP for every 3 seconds in the vault). The higher EXP, the higher the APR, the higher the rTRAVA reward.  Normal Farming  Heuristic Farming  Number of vaults  5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities  5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities  Number of Knights allowed in one vault  1 Knight  ≥≥1 Knight  Reward in tokens  None  rTRAVA  EXP reward  One EXP is released for each second Knights in the vaults  One EXP is released for 3 second Knights in the vaults  With the new and improved mechanism, the EXP points are a crucial element in the development of the Trava Knight NFT journey. Like the current Farming mechanism, Heuristic Farming also has a Polishing mechanism. The polishing mechanism in Heuristic Farming helps NFT owners maintain 100% rewards and supports increasing EXP and APY.  Note that, Knights with 0 EXP still gain rewards from Heuristic Farming. Moreover, with rTRAVA from Heuristic Farming, users can auto-stake in our rTRAVA with no locking period in our Staking Program. rTRAVA then can be locked in Trava Governance vault to gain locking power as veTRAVA and earn more rewards.

At the initial state of the protocol, the index is 1.0, which means the conversion is 1:1. The index will increase through the rebase process to track how much users’ TOD balance has increased from auto-compounding reward. Index will never decrease, only increase. D: DAO Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a governance mechanism for making decisions in a more trustless and collaborative way. Voting rights are often bound to a governance token. Discount Users have a chance to buy TOD with a discount by purchasing Bonds. When the demand for Bonds gets too high, the bond price might rise above its market price, therefore the discount might have a negative value. M: Market Cap The market cap (or market capitalization) is the total dollar value of TOD tokens in circulation. Market Value of Treasury Assets Market Value of Treasury Assets is the sum of the value (in dollars) of all assets held by the treasury Multi-chain Deployment TraDAO will be deployed on multiple chains in the future, which opens more opportunities for new investors to get more rewards while bonding and staking in our TraDAO system. N: Next Reward Amount The next reward amount is the increasing number of a user’s TOD balance in the next rebase. Next Reward Yield Reward yield is the interest rate for compounding staking. This reward yield depends on the total value staked and the treasury’s balance. It may change each epoch to achieve sustainable reward emission. P: Protocol Owned Liquidity Protocol Owned Liquidity is the amount of LP the treasury owns and controls Purchased Every bond program has a capacity, set at the opening time and can not be changed. Purchased parameter is the percentage of bond sold over its capacity. R: Reward Rate Reward rate is the configured percentage of TOD distributed to all stakers on each rebase relative to the total supply. The reward rate is precisely adjusted based on user benefit and runaway time available by protocol policy. Risk-Free Value (RFV) Risk-Free Value is the amount of funds the treasury guarantees to use for backing TOD. There are two types of assets reserved in the treasury: stablecoins and LP tokens. S: Secondary Bond Marketplace A bond marketplace allows users to auction and purchase liquidated bonds, immature bonds,... It provides users another gateway to bond and takes advantage of liquidated bonds or immature bonds to leverage their profit through Staking Strategy. Staking ROI T: TOD Reputation TOD reputation is a parameter to evaluate holders’ loyalty to the token TOD, expressing the trust and reputation of the holder in the token community. Total Supply TOD is an uncapped token with a dynamic supply depending on market supply-demand. TOD supply increases when minted by Treasury only: 1. TOD is minted and distributed as stakers’ rewards. 2. TOD is minted from bond revenues whenever someone purchases a bond: - TOD is minted for bonders when they redeem after the vesting period and unstake. - TOD is minted for DAO, determined by a rate set by the policy team. Total Value Staked The total value staked is the number of TOD tokens users staked in the staking contract, multiplied by TOD’s price on the market. Treasury The treasury is a basket of assets (e.g., BUSD, DAI, TOD-BUSD LP…) to back the value of TOD. Treasury Balance Complete name is the market value of treasury assets. Treasury balance is defined as the total market value of all registered assets in the treasury. V: Vesting Time After purchasing bonds, TOD tokens will be available for claiming after a vesting period… Users can keep track of their bonds’ vesting time in the My Bond section from UI. While vesting, your TOD tokens are automatically staked. There is two types of vesting terms: * Fixed expiration: vesting time will be the time difference between the time of purchasing until the bond closes. If the bond is vested at 10:00 AM, March 14, any notes purchased can be redeemed after that time. * Fixed term: vesting time will always be a duration set per bond. If the vesting is 7 days, you can redeem it exactly 7 days after buying it.

What is Token Health and how can it measure a crypto risk?,0.8868,True,"['What is Token Health?  Token Health is an index to evaluate the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava is the world-first lending platform that provides this index by collecting and aggregating various types of data from blockchain networks. The health of each token is evaluated as a specific value in the range of [0; 1000]. This health index gives the users a comprehensive overview of tokens in the cryptocurrency world and thus facilitates TRAVA lending and other DEFI businesses. Original features in Trava Token Health  Standardizing value for each indicator: There have been a few projects providing information on tokens such as Coingecko, CoinMarketCap, LunarCrush, CREAM Finance, DMM Exchange, etc. They typically present multiple types of on-chain data represented by raw numbers only. For example, they show the market capitalization of tokens but do not standardize those values, which makes it harder for users to understand the meaning of the values or make a comparison among different tokens. Performing standardization for the numeric indicators, Trava allows users to quickly assess different tokens in terms of MarketCap, Trading Volume, Token Price, etc.  Aggregate all indicators into a single index: Similar projects simply present multiple token indicators to users without combining them into a single index to make a comprehensive assessment of tokens. Trava Token Health Model, which is a user-oriented model, has been built to address this inconvenience by computing those separate indicators and combining all of them into an insightful index, i.e., Token Health. Users can use this single value to evaluate the health of a token and can quickly decide to invest in the token or not.  Utilizing both absolute and relative indicators: The absolute indicators are commonly used in many token-analyzing projects, while relative values are typically being overlooked. The absolute and separated values do not provide many complete insights, as those values \u200b\u200bare not correlated with each other. Different from other projects, Trava makes use of both absolute and relative indicators to evaluate the Token Health in the most precise and overall manner. Let us take an example with tokens A and B. The trading volume of token A is $100M, while that of token B is $10M. People tend to quickly jump to the conclusion that token A outweighs token B with regards to the trading volume. However, when considering the market cap of the two tokens, it shows that the MarketCap of token A is 1000 times greater than that of token A. Thus, in the correlation with the MarketCap, the trading volume of token B is in fact much more impressive than that of token A. The example shows that, by combining absolute and relative indicators, Trava Model provides more comprehensive insights compared with related projects.  Customized UI for each user: The UI for Trava Token Heath can be customized for individual preference. Trava provides users with the leaderboard of all tokens, ranked by the total score (i.e., Token Health) or other single indicators such as market cap, token price, and trading volume. Users can access the historical charts of each indicator to get more insights. Moreover, what makes Trava Token Health special compared to the related projects is that Trava enables users to customize the charts based on their preferences. For example, they can add their favorite tokens with their preferable indicators in a single chart to compare and evaluate multiple tokens in an easy, time-saving, and elegant manner.  Various types of indicators: The Trava Token Health model is constructed based on various parameters in different aspects of DeFi. There are seven main parameters; all are selected and analyzed under a strict process before being deployed to ensure the most reliability and creditworthiness. In addition to the absolute values, we also calculate and analyze the relative values such as: the price over the highest score or the trading volume over the MarketCap. We also consider the fluctuation of the values over time. The detailed model will be presented in the next section Trava Token Health model  Trava has studied and developed an exclusive token rating model. The model takes into account various types of data. At present, the data is grouped into seven main indicators including (1) Market cap, (2) Number of transactions, (3) Volume of transactions, (4) Number of holders, (5) Distribution of tokens to holders, (6) Price, and (7) Price stability. Each indicator in turn is evaluated based on several sub-parameters. The use of Trava Token Health  One of the significant benefits of Token Health is to reduce risks. When participating in the crypto world, users have to face many types of risks such as token price crashes or collateral liquidation when borrowing. Token Health will be a useful tool for users to minimize these risks. They can determine which tokens should not be invested at certain times to avoid risks. Let us take an example of how two major risks can be addressed by Trava Token Health:      Risk of token liquidity. In the DeFi field, price fluctuations can result in risks of loan liquidation for both the pool owners and liquidity providers. With Trava Token Health, the pool owner can choose stable price tokens to allow performing actions in the pool to avoid this risk.     Risk of token inflation. Tokens with high inflation are more likely to have a price crash. Users in DeFi can suffer significant losses due to such crashes. With Trava Token Health, users have a full overview of token price, using our price stability indicator, the price over the highest score, or the Token Health index. This information is an effective tool for users to avoid the risk of tokens’ price crashes.  Moreover, Trava Token Health assists users to make optimal decisions on token investing. In the past, choosing which tokens to invest, lend or borrow, was a major problem for users in the crypto world because there was no credible basis for them to assess the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava Token Health allows users to observe the history of multiple token indicators and the overall Token Health index to be more confident when making their investment decisions.']","['A: Age of the wallet (day) The period that the wallet has participated in the crypto market since its first transaction.

PreviousBricher GlossaryNextTraDAO Glossary Last updated 2 years ago', 'In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. TRAVA.FINANCE uses credit scores to ensure the safety of the lending process. Pool owners and lenders can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. Based on the credit scores, they can determine the maximum Loan-To-Value ratio for borrowers. Borrowers with high credit scores get preferential treatment; they can borrow cryptos with more favorable interest rates and Loan-To-Value ratios. Credit scores provide an incentive for users to (i) hold their wallet addresses as long as possible and keep them clean, (ii) perform the cross-chain identification protocol to interlink their addresses, (iii) perform more transactions inside and outside TRAVA.FINANCE, and so on. This increases crypto liquidity and fosters the growth of the DeFi system. The credit score evaluation in TRAVA.FINANCE is primarily based on on-chain data. At present, we collect, enrich, and analyze Binance Smart Chain transactions, including the native transferring transactions and the transactions to deposit, withdraw, repay, and borrow tokens generated from Binance Smart Chain lending DApps. TRAVA.FINANCE evaluates credit scores for both wallet addresses and other digital assets. Wallet addresses operated for a long time with good transaction history (e.g., an address that has transactions with many other addresses, always pays debts on time, and performs transactions frequently) will have a high credit score. Pool owners can use credit scores as a criterion to select competent wallet addresses for their pool’s liquidity providers. The credit rating of digital assets helps pool owners and liquid providers to minimize liquidity risk. TRAVA.FINANCE divides digital assets into two categories: Tokens/coins and other digital assets (e.g., NFT, smart contracts, stoke tokens) and evaluates their credit scores. The credit score of a **Token** is assessed based on 4 parameters, i.e., (i) the token price, (ii) the market cap (MC) of the token, (iii) the token trading volume, and (iv) the number of transactions related to the token. High-credit-score tokens have a great advantage over low-credit-score tokens. Once being used as collaterals, they offer high loan-to-value ratios to borrowers; lenders also get favorable lending interest rates with their high-credit-score tokens. Users can improve their credit scores once they possess those high-valuable digital assets. TRAVA.FINANCE also performs credit ratings for other **digital assets such as NFT**. The credit scores for NFTs are estimated based on the number of times that they have been auctioned on TRAVA.FINANCE or other trusted platforms. NFTs’ scores should not depend on their price because their price is typically determined in an unreliable manner, based on the emotion and the preference of customers. To evaluate credit scores for a wallet address, TRAVA.FINANCE credit scoring model will take into account the following factors: * _Total asset_. The total asset represents the financial strength of the wallet address; it is the most intuitive and easiest-to-evaluate parameter. It is also the second most important parameter that affects credit scores. The total asset is the sum of balance and total investment minus total liabilities. The credit score of the address is proportional to its total asset. As this parameter is a volatility index, the credit score is calculated based on both the _average total asset_ in a certain period and the _total current asset_. * _Transaction history_. Transaction history is the most important parameter; it has a major impact on credit scores. TRAVA.FINANCE collects and aggregates all exchanges, loans, deposits, and other transactions of the wallet address across multiple DApps to calculate various intermediate parameters such as (i) the age of the address, (ii) its transaction amount, (iii) its frequency of transaction, (iv) its number of liquidations and (v) its total value of liquidations. * _Loan ratios_. Loan ratios (debt ratios) represent the debt position of the account. It is divided into two sub-parameters, i.e., loan-to-balance ratio and loan-to-investment ratio. * _Circulating assets_. This parameter represents how active users are in the crypto market. The more money they invest in the crypto market, the more creditworthiness they gain from others. This parameter is evaluated based on 2 sub-parameters, (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE (Return on equity). * _Trustworthiness of possessing assets_. The last parameter for credit rating is the trustworthiness of the assets owned by the wallet address. The wallet can improve its credit score by possessing high-value and trustworthy digital assets. At present, TRAVA.FINANCE evaluates two types of digital assets only (i.e, Token and NFT).

What is users’ credit score? : In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. What benefits does credit score brings to users? : -For borrowers, the primary benefit is that they can borrow with a ""preferential interest rate"" if their credit score is high. They can also receive higher loan-to-value-ratio compared to other users For lenders, who have high credit scores easily become LPs of different pools. Moreover, when they create a pool, their pool will have a higher credit score because the pool creator\'s credit score is also a criterion for the pool scoring. Especially, pool owners can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. How Credit scores for wallet addresses are calculated? : To evaluate credit scores for wallet addresses, TRAVA credit scoring model will take into account 5 factors: 1. Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address. 2. Transaction history: TRAVA aggregates all transactions of a wallet address across all platforms to calculate various parameters such as (i) transaction amount, (ii) number of liquidations, etc. 3. Loans ratio: represents the debt position of an account, including the Loan-to-balance ratio and Loan-to-investment ratio. 4. Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. 5. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range. The z-score is calculated from the mean and the standard deviation from every corresponding parameter of all accounts. To be more specific, you can read this function in TRAVA whitepaper. How the user\'s credit score will be updated? : Our system has both periodic updates and instant updates. The instant update occurs when users actively make transactions such as deposit, withdraw, repay... Or when users view their credit score on our app. In case a user has not viewed their credit score and had no transactions for a long time, their credit score is still updated periodically and automatically, which can be weekly or monthly. We are still trying to optimize it. Which objects does Trava evaluate credit score for? : At the moment, Trava has been evaluating the credit scores for 3 types of Objects: Wallet addresses (users), tokens, and NFTs. How to increase my credit score? : To improve the credit score of your wallet, you would need to take into account our five parameters, i.e., Total asset, Transaction history, Loans ratios, Circulating assets, and Trustworthiness of possessing assets. For instance, you should increase your wallet balance with prestige coins and tokens, perform more transactions and become more active in the crypto market, maintaining good Loan-to-balance and Loan-to-investment ratios, supply more liquidity to lending pools, trade on lending DApps to earn as much profit as you can, avoid collateral liquidation while borrowing, and possess at least $1000 valuable token (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, or BNB). Besides, you need to be credible users for a long time. It is because to avoid fraud, TRAVA calculates some credit score parameters based on their average values in the last k days, where k depends on the volatility of the crypto market. Moreover, some parameters are assessed based on the “standardized score” function, which calculates the mean and the standard deviation of all accounts’ parameters. Thus, trying to be the best at some criteria would improve your credit score too. Why did my credit score decrease? : The reasons why your credit score drops might be: You have bad transactions such as borrowing liquidations, your balance decrease, your borrowing rate is higher, you are not active enough, etc...You can read our white paper to understand how the credit score mechanism functions. https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/credit-score-evaluation PreviousTroubleshootingNextNFTs Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?', 'In particular, if a user is currently depositing tokens, after a period of time \\Delta{t} (in seconds) he will receive an interest of ××Δt,T_t \\times D_t \\times \\Delta{t}, and this interest is accrued to the deposited token, i.e. after time \\Delta{t} he have Tt+Δt=×(1+×Δt).T_{t+\\Delta{t}} = T_t \\times (1 + D_t \\times \\Delta{t}).= PreviousIntroductionNextRisk parameters Last updated 3 years ago Was this helpful?', 'TRAVA FINANCE AT TOKEN2049: RECAP & FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS: Published in 4 min readApr 25, 2024 Share Token2049 was held in Dubai this year (2024), standing as a pivotal event in the blockchain and DeFi realm, serving as a nexus for Web3 insights and collaborative learning. With thousands of participants, ranging from startups to industry whales, the atmosphere buzzed with excitement, spanning topics from NFTs to crypto regulations. Trava Finance team also presented at this year’s Token2049 event, which was immensely productive as we successfully fostered countless meaningful meet-ups and discussions. Keep on reading for the Recap of our time in Dubai & Trava Finance’s next developments. Trava Team’s experience at Token2049 Embarking on a journey to the Token2049 Conference in Dubai was not without its challenges for Trava Finance. The skies were cloudy, the rain poured heavily, and transportation snags plagued attendees. My flight endured a two-hour delay before landing due to bad weather, followed by a lengthy wait for a taxi as no public transportation was working. Despite these setbacks, what awaited at Token2049 was beyond our expectations. Dubai, with its rapidly growing infrastructure and crypto-friendly regulations, proved to be an ideal host for this gathering of crypto enthusiasts. The resilience of attendees amidst adverse weather conditions showcased the community’s spirit and determination. Even with the city facing its worst rains in dozens of years, the Token2049 event proceeded smoothly, highlighting the organizers’ efficiency and dedication. The conference hall buzzed with excitement as participants delved into discussions on Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, blockchain innovations, market fluctuations, and Dubai’s emergence as a hub for crypto ventures. Token2049 was a melting pot of creativity and ingenuity, with attendees presenting groundbreaking ideas spanning AI-blockchain integration, DeFi innovations, and hybrid financial applications. Trava team took advantage of this opportunity to meet face-to-face with many interesting and creative people, united by a shared passion for blockchain’s transformative potential. In-person connections and relationships are truly key to success. While social media platforms like Twitter and Telegram offer avenues for exchange, nothing can replace the authenticity of human interaction — the firm handshake, the warm embrace, the laughter shared over drinks, as well as on-the-spot questions & answers. Thanks to these diverse talks with great minds, we have also gained significant benefits, becoming more certain about our previously made decisions and coming up with new ideas for the development of Trava Finance. We will go deeper in the next part. Trava Finance’s upcoming moves For TRAVA token: We are currently having discussions about listings on CEX, such as XT or BingX. However, this is still being considered further, based on the market situation and opportunities. Technology & products: Thanks to the discussions about the requirements for creating a convenient DeFi space for users at the Token2049 event, Trava Finance is even more confident to be on the right track — developing Smart Wallet. This tool has been and will continue to be a gateway that allows users to conduct all transactions on DeFi, not just limited to Trava Ecosystem. Besides, our team has heard some talks about upcoming technology trends, like creating super apps on messenger chat. Therefore, we have an idea to build ourselves a Chatbot and integrate it into Telegram to keep up with the flow. We are also currently developing an AI chatbot called Trava GPT, aiming to entirely reduce the barrier for end users on Web3. For TCV: Our current direction is to add features that allow users to create investment strategies in lending, in addition to the automatic ticker selection strategy on Uniswap v3. Conclusion Token2049 was not just a conference; it was a testament to the boundless possibilities of blockchain technology. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, events like these serve as beacons of innovation and inspiration for a more equitable and transparent world. Trava Finance is very pleased to have joined Token2049, thereby receiving extremely valuable insights and contributing to our next developments.

It means you would be no longer entitled to the potential upside value gain. Whereas, by borrowing, you can still obtain these potential earnings (working capital) without losing your asset. You can borrow when unexpected expenses happen and leverage your holding assets for other investment opportunities. How to borrow? : In order to borrow, you need to deposit any asset to be used as collateral first (check out the Depositing & Earning FAQ section for more info). After depositing, you simply go to the “Borrow” section and click the “Borrow” button on the asset you want to borrow. Input the amount and approve the transaction. The borrowed amount is based on the available deposits that you used as collateral. What is the maximum amount can I borrow? : The maximum amount you can borrow depends on your deposited value and the available liquidity. Please notice the health factor and liquidation threshold indicators to guarantee your collaterals are in the state of safety. Besides, you can not borrow if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor is too low. What type of asset do I repay my loans? : When repaying a loan, the type of asset that you need to repay is in the same asset you borrowed. For example, if you borrow 1 BNB you will pay back 1 BNB plus interest accrued. Another way to pay back the loan is using your collateral. If you want to pay back the loan based on USD price you can borrow any of the available stable coins as USDC, DAI, USDT, etc. How much interest would I pay for my loans? : When borrowing, the interest rate you need to pay depends on the borrowing rate which is determined from the supply and demand ratio of the asset. Moreover, the interest rate is a variable rate so that it changes constantly. The current borrowing rate of your borrowed assets is shown in the Borrowing section of your dashboard, you can check it any time. What is Health factor? : Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation? : The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals. When do I need to repay the loan? : As long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan.

Explain TRADAO and its public offering.,0.8843,True,"['What is TRADAO?  TRADAO is the world’s first protocol supporting multi-chain deployment in DeFi 2.0, and also Web 3.0 compatible. TraDAO is protocol owned liquidity (POL), accumulating value through such activities of bonding and auto-compound staking which are regulated by Trava Treasury. As a product in Trava ecosystem, the liquidity owned by TRADAO protocol could be deposited in Trava Lending Pool to generate more profit and this profit will be shared among users in the entire Trava ecosystem.  TRADAO Protocol will issue a decentralized reserve currency — called TOD. The concept behind TOD token is that it is backed by a basket of assets in Trava Treasury that ensures it does not fall below its base value of $1. The TOD token will be released based on the “Mint & Burn” mechanism, managed by no one other than TRADAO protocol. Why is TRADAO different compared to other OHM forks?  In comparison to other initiatives in the DeFi 2.0 space, TRADAO Protocol offers a number of unique advantages to users. How does it work?  Our Bonding allows users to buy TOD at a discounted price compared with exchanges in other assets such as stablecoins, LP tokens, and so on. The number of TOD tokens that the bonder is entitled to will be vested in a certain term.  Bond Installment is a one-of-a-kind feature that allows users to buy more TOD with a little initial amount of assets, then leverage benefits in Staking Strategy, and pay off the debt. Your bond shall be automatically staked after you use Bond Installment.  Wallet Reputation will be integrated with this product in the form of a reference to decide which user will have more benefits (i.e, lower prepaid rate, lower interest fee rate, higher liquidation discount rate,…). For example, holding assets in the Trava Ecosystem can be considered as a condition to gain a high wallet reputation.  Our Staking allows bonders to stake their TOD token in our auto-compounding vault and earn rebase rewards, after receiving TOD tokens from bond sales. The rebase rewards are also from bond sales held in Trava treasury, or profit of the protocol.', 'We are opening two public offering rounds to give our loyal users as well as our new investors more opportunities to take part in the TraDAO Protocol at the very first stage. In both rounds, participants will buy $TOD tokens in BUSD. The details of two rounds are as the table below:  To get off to a good start, Trava will contribute to TraDAO Protocol with $50,000 worth of 20,000 $TOD tokens. This support is to ensure initial liquidity of $TOD and show the commitment of Trava team in developing TraDAO protocol, thus bringing trust to our community and staying the true ideology of Trava since the beginning, that is a fair launch project and independent of any whale or VCs. The funds from sale will be used to back the $TOD sold and provide initial liquidity after listing.  If we are 100% subscribed, the sale will bring in $345,000. $105,000 will be deposited to the treasury to back initial supply. The remaining $240,000 will be added as liquidity. The LP will open on PancakeSwap with 240,000 BUSD and 20,000 $TOD, in addition to 85,000 $TOD from Public Offering and contribution of Trava Team. This means the starting price of $TOD is $12, and total initial liquidity on Pancakeswap is $480,000 of both tokens. Thus, the total Initial Supply of $TOD will be 105,000 $TOD. How can I join Public Offering?  We will also open two (02) Rounds of Whitelist, which will then be merged to one Final Whitelist at the end. The two rounds open to welcome new Knights and incentives for Loyal Knights in the TRAVA ecosystem as follows:      Whitelist Round 1 (will be live on Jan 21st) — Power up TRADAO — To welcome new members into TRAVA Ecosystem     Whitelist Round 2 (will be live on Jan 28th) — Cheer up Trava Knights — To honor TRAVA loyal users  Participants in the Final Whitelist will have a lucky ticket in buying $TOD Token at the cheapest price before it hits the official launch on PancakeSwap. When you buy, you are removed from the whitelist; if some people buy less than their share, everyone who has not yet bought will get a higher allocation. The details of each Round will be released in our next announcements.  After the public offering rounds, we plan to open two strategies of Bonding and Staking for users to leverage their rewards and earn profit from them. We also have a plan to allow Bond Installment and Wallet Reputation for Bond purchases, which creates a perfect gateway for users with small funds to invest and profit from the protocol.']","['Register **Registration Error** × Looks like your connection to Trava Forum was lost, please wait while we try to reconnect.', ""A: APY Annual Percentage Yield is the normalized representation of an interest rate, based on a compounding period over one year. Note that APYs provided are ballpark level indicators and not precise future results. Auto-compound Staking The rewards from the staking program are compounded. The compounding period of approximately 8 hours explains the high APY. B: Backing per TOD Every TOD in circulation is backed by the TraDAO treasury, composed of stablecoins, TOD-stablecoin LP tokens, and other assets. Backing per TOD is the dollar value of each TOD token based on the backing reserve. Backing Reserves Backing Reserves is the sum of all reserve assets' RFV value from the treasury. Bond Installment Installment bonding is one of the regulations of TraDAO, which allow users to pay partly in a certain time when buying bonds; they don’t have to pay all in one go. They can deposit bonds to auto-compound vaults to earn rewards and payout original debt plus corresponding interest debt. C: Circulating Supply The best approximation of the number of TOD tokens circulating in the market and in the general public's hands. Current Index When users stake TOD, they will receive xTOD tokens. The index value represents the conversion ratio between TOD and xTOD. At the initial state of the protocol, the index is 1.0, which means the conversion is 1:1. The index will increase through the rebase process to track how much users’ TOD balance has increased from auto-compounding reward. Index will never decrease, only increase. D: DAO Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a governance mechanism for making decisions in a more trustless and collaborative way. Voting rights are often bound to a governance token. Discount Users have a chance to buy TOD with a discount by purchasing Bonds. When the demand for Bonds gets too high, the bond price might rise above its market price, therefore the discount might have a negative value. M: Market Cap The market cap (or market capitalization) is the total dollar value of TOD tokens in circulation. Market Value of Treasury Assets Market Value of Treasury Assets is the sum of the value (in dollars) of all assets held by the treasury Multi-chain Deployment TraDAO will be deployed on multiple chains in the future, which opens more opportunities for new investors to get more rewards while bonding and staking in our TraDAO system. N: Next Reward Amount The next reward amount is the increasing number of a user’s TOD balance in the next rebase. Next Reward Yield Reward yield is the interest rate for compounding staking. This reward yield depends on the total value staked and the treasury’s balance. It may change each epoch to achieve sustainable reward emission. P: Protocol Owned Liquidity Protocol Owned Liquidity is the amount of LP the treasury owns and controls Purchased Every bond program has a capacity, set at the opening time and can not be changed. Purchased parameter is the percentage of bond sold over its capacity. R: Reward Rate Reward rate is the configured percentage of TOD distributed to all stakers on each rebase relative to the total supply. The reward rate is precisely adjusted based on user benefit and runaway time available by protocol policy. Risk-Free Value (RFV) Risk-Free Value is the amount of funds the treasury guarantees to use for backing TOD. There are two types of assets reserved in the treasury: stablecoins and LP tokens. S: Secondary Bond Marketplace A bond marketplace allows users to auction and purchase liquidated bonds, immature bonds,... It provides users another gateway to bond and takes advantage of liquidated bonds or immature bonds to leverage their profit through Staking Strategy. Staking ROI T: TOD Reputation TOD reputation is a parameter to evaluate holders’ loyalty to the token TOD, expressing the trust and reputation of the holder in the token community. Total Supply TOD is an uncapped token with a dynamic supply depending on market supply-demand. TOD supply increases when minted by Treasury only: 1. TOD is minted and distributed as stakers’ rewards. 2. TOD is minted from bond revenues whenever someone purchases a bond: - TOD is minted for bonders when they redeem after the vesting period and unstake. - TOD is minted for DAO, determined by a rate set by the policy team. Total Value Staked The total value staked is the number of TOD tokens users staked in the staking contract, multiplied by TOD’s price on the market. Treasury The treasury is a basket of assets (e.g., BUSD, DAI, TOD-BUSD LP…) to back the value of TOD. Treasury Balance Complete name is the market value of treasury assets. Treasury balance is defined as the total market value of all registered assets in the treasury. V: Vesting Time After purchasing bonds, TOD tokens will be available for claiming after a vesting period… Users can keep track of their bonds’ vesting time in the My Bond section from UI. While vesting, your TOD tokens are automatically staked. There is two types of vesting terms: * Fixed expiration: vesting time will be the time difference between the time of purchasing until the bond closes. If the bond is vested at 10:00 AM, March 14, any notes purchased can be redeemed after that time. * Fixed term: vesting time will always be a duration set per bond. If the vesting is 7 days, you can redeem it exactly 7 days after buying it.
