'],"['Register **Registration Error** × Looks like your connection to Trava Forum was lost, please wait while we try to reconnect.', 'A Smart Wallet: Create your smart wallet here if you haven’t had it yet: https://app.trava.finance/station Next, you just need to do a simple thing: asking TravaGPT to deposit/ stake with Smart Wallet in Trava Finance lending pool/ Trava Staking and Trava Finance. ⚠️ Especially, remember to ensure this NOTE: When you stake/ deposit in Trava pools/vaults, you’ll have your own APR reward and PLUS 20% of the APR. HOWEVER: ✅ Leaving the reward in the vault until the campaign ends, you will earn an extra 20% APR. ❌ Withdrawing the reward before the campaign ends, you will NOT receive that extra 20% APR. Sixth Question: Many users are still confused a little bit about the Rewards of the campaign, especially the 20% APR PLUS. Could you give us a clear explanation for those rewards? The 20% APR PUS means that you will have an additional 20% of the APR you have when depositing/staking in Trava pool/vault. To make things simple, I will give you the formula for this reward: APR + (20% * APR) ** For example, when you stake tokens in Trava Staking and have 4.5% APR. In this campaign, you will not only have that 4.5% APR but also an additional 20% of that APR, which is 0.9% Remember that you also have Extra Rewards and Lottery Rewards, alongside the 20% APR PLUS. 👉 So let’s join us and get yourself in this LEADERBOARD: Answers community questions The AMA also provided insightful answers to the community’s questions on Twitter and during the event on Telegram. Twitter Questions: : “Could you explain how TravaGPT V3.0 enhances the user experience within the TRAVA ecosystem, particularly in navigating decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms? What specific features does TravaGPT V3.0 offer to users, and how does it streamline interactions across different DeFi protocols on the TRAVA platform?” Because I’ve provided the information that covered the question ‘What specific features does TravaGPT V3.0 offer to users?”. So I’ll answer the rest. TravaGPT V3.0 introduces advanced features designed to enhance the user experience within the TRAVA ecosystem, especially in navigating decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and streamlining interactions across various DeFi protocols on the TRAVA platform: ✅ Execute DeFi applications using natural language. ✅ Access everything in one place without needing to visit individual applications to perform transactions. : “How are rewards on the leaderboard calculated? Can you give more information about the lottery prize?” Firstly, regarding the leaderboard, it displays the rewards users have earned after converting from the 20% APR PLUS. You can take a look at the formula I’ve mentioned to understand how it is calculated: APR + (20% * APR)” Secondly, regarding the Lotter prize, this is a reward that will be distributed randomly to lucky winners. But only participants in this campaign (who appear on the Leaderboard) can join this Lottery. : “How can I claim rewards using TravaGPT in Trava Staking? and What are the advantages of using TravaGPT for governance actions in Trava?” To claim rewards in Trava Staking, you just need to enter TravaGPT and type the order: “I want to claim rewards in Trava Staking” TravaGPT will provide you with a form like this to let you give more details of the order. With just a few clicks, TravaGPT will automatically complete the transactions for you. As you can see, the usual process with many steps to perform actions in Trava has been reduced to just a few clicks with TravaGPT. This means you can save time and enjoy a more convenient experience when using TravaGPT for actions in Trava Governance. Additionally, you can currently earn an extra APR by creating locks in Trava Governance through TravaGPT. The campaign will only last for around 1 month, so let’s join it soon!

Trava Station Trava Station serves as a center of Trava Finance, aiming to help users in the Trava ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving them time and money when making transactions. With Trava Station, instead of having to move between dApps and platforms to perform actions, you can combine them all together in one transaction.

Let’s see how you can aggregate multiple actions in one transaction and how much gas fees you can save in the picture below. Save more with Trava Station At present, Trava Station has 6 features: ➡️ Freight : Allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands. ➡️ Tramlines : Provides a list of pre-made shortcuts to do common actions. ➡️ Junction : Allow users to pre-set transactions to be auto-executed when the conditions are met. ➡️ Portfolio : A real-time report that keeps track of all your activities and assets in Trava Station. ➡️ Analytics : Get real-time analysis of the market as well as user preference in Trava Finance. ➡️ Recommendations : Provide a thorough analysis and prediction of DEXs’ parameters. Smart Wallet Smart Wallet is an advanced digital tool that relies on smart contracts, which are only created and owned by the user. Setting apart from other normal wallets, it eliminates the need for private keys or seed phrases. Using a smart wallet offers more advantages for users: * Save fees and streamline transaction process : They enable a smoother DeFi experience by combining multiple transactions into one, reducing transaction fees. * Enhanced user experience and privacy : Smart Wallets offer convenience while improving security, appealing to both new and experienced users by utilizing smart contracts to reduce dependence on private keys. * Additional features and security : Smart Wallets can support multi-signature transactions, add extra layers of security through app authentication, limit daily transaction amounts, and prevent potential errors or theft. Smart Wallet is incorporated in Trava Station and TravaGPT to optimize DeFi actions for users in Trava Finance. Specifically, with Trava Station, your assets are temporarily moved to a Smart Wallet to execute all your actions in a single transaction, making the process smoother. After the actions are completed, your assets are returned to your main wallet (like Metamask or Trust Wallet). To have your own Smart Wallet, you just need to connect your wallet to Trava Finance and go to the Freight tab of Trava Station to create it.

While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA also offers the credit score function based on financial data on-chain analysis as a useful tool that reduces risk and increases profits for all users. We build our solutions on TRAVA.FINANCE whose smart contracts are deployed on BSC network, so the speed of transactions, gas fees, and robustness depend on BSC network. However, in the near future, we will allow cross-chain lending in our platform. Please join the the Trava team and members of the community look forward to helping you understand and use Trava. Why should we trust Trava? : Trava Protocol has been audited and secured internally, by third parties (Hacken, Certik) and even Community Checks. Check https://docs.trava.finance/security/ for more information. How to interconnect with Trava protocol? : In order to interconnect with Trava protocol, you need to deposit your asset into lending pools. After depositing, you will earn passive income, this income is based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, you can also borrow by using your deposited assets as collateral. Do I need to pay fees to interconnect with Trava protocol? : Interacting with the protocol requires transactions and so transaction fees for BSC Blockchain usage, which depend on the network status and transaction complexity. Where are my deposited tokens stored? : After depositing, your deposit funds are stored in a smart contract. The code of the smart contract is public, open-source, formally verified, and audited by third-party auditors. You can withdraw your funds from the pool back to your wallet. What does Trava do to avoid risk? : Risk can occur in smart contracts not only on BSC but also on other networks. To ensure the safe, we have several strategies as follows: * Auditing code performed by third parties: we have been audited by Hacken and Certik. We are contacting others. * Audit internally our code. We have a strong team with high-security skills. * Community check: we will organize hackathon events and reward programs that encourage the community to detect risks. What are the TRAVA token and its utility? : We issue TRAVA tokens based on Binance smart chain's BEP-20 standard; the total supply is 5 billion. These TRAVA tokens can be used in: * Reward: Pool owners can set up rewards paid by TRAVA token. Thus, lending pool depositors will earn rewards by TRAVA token. * Collateral and lending: Users can use TRAVA as mortgages. The users also loan TRAVA. * Payment for lending fees: Users can pay pool lending fees by TRAVA. * Payment for pool management: Pool owners can pay for the pool creation, update (e.g., pool parameters, add/remove tokens, …), and pause by TRAVA. * Payment for auction deposits: in the NFTs auction process, TRAVA can be used as a locked asset. * Payment for auction organization: To perform all auction actions for NFT, the NFT’s owners (auction organizers) can pay the auction fees by TRAVA. * Staking for a data validator: To store credit data stored on the knowledge graph chain, the data must be confirmed by validators. The process is built up to eliminate redundant, unnecessary, and insecure data. The knowledge graph data validators stake by TRAVA. * Staking to participate in the governance process: TRAVA.FINANCE will become a community solution, thus the TRAVA.FINANCE’s rules are elected by participants, who hold TRAVA’s token. Tokenomics? : Documentation on tokenomics and governance is available in the White Paper Does Trava have a Mobile App? : Be careful, we don’t provide any downloaded applications for mobile.

Mr. Thang Nguyen: People always think Bug Bounty is a difficult game, however, in Trava Finance version, it’s actually just a piece of cake. Because the objective of this Bug Bounty is to invite the community to join a hand in strengthening Trava Finance, the program is set with straightforward rules: 🗡 If you find any bugs related to the User interface (UI), Logical Flow, and Security, please let us know with a detailed description 🗡. The bug can be realized easily by anyone, even non-IT people. To make it easier for you to understand, let’s go through some examples of each bug type: ➡️ User interface (UI): * Broken or Misaligned Buttons: Buttons are not properly aligned or are overlapping with other elements, making them difficult to click or use. * Invisible Text: Text is the same color as the background, making it impossible to read. * Elements Not Scaling Properly on Different Devices: The design does not adapt to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile vs. desktop — Macos, Windows, …), causing elements to look distorted or disappear. … ➡️ Logical Flow: * Incorrect Calculation Results: The app performs incorrect calculations or logic processing. * Incorrect Date or Time Logic: The countdown system of the vault is wrong or the scheduling system allows users to choose the date/time in the past. … ➡️ Security Issue * Insufficient Authorization Checks: The app does not properly check user permissions, allowing users to access or perform actions they shouldn’t be able to. * Smart contract vulnerability.

After a process of development, TravaGPT has reached version 3.0 , incorporating more powerful functions than a mere chatbot. With TravaGPT, you just need to tell it what you want to know or to do, it will provide you not only useful information but also complete the actions for you.

Trava Station Trava Station serves as a center of Trava Finance, aiming to help users in the Trava ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving them time and money when making transactions. With Trava Station, instead of having to move between dApps and platforms to perform actions, you can combine them all together in one transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time and gas costs compared to when doing separate actions. Let’s see how you can aggregate multiple actions in one transaction and how much gas fees you can save in the picture below. Save more with Trava Station At present, Trava Station has 6 features: ➡️ Freight : Allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands. ➡️ Tramlines : Provides a list of pre-made shortcuts to do common actions. ➡️ Junction : Allow users to pre-set transactions to be auto-executed when the conditions are met. ➡️ Portfolio : A real-time report that keeps track of all your activities and assets in Trava Station. ➡️ Analytics : Get real-time analysis of the market as well as user preference in Trava Finance. ➡️ Recommendations : Provide a thorough analysis and prediction of DEXs’ parameters. Smart Wallet Smart Wallet is an advanced digital tool that relies on smart contracts, which are only created and owned by the user. Setting apart from other normal wallets, it eliminates the need for private keys or seed phrases. Using a smart wallet offers more advantages for users: * Save fees and streamline transaction process : They enable a smoother DeFi experience by combining multiple transactions into one, reducing transaction fees. * Enhanced user experience and privacy : Smart Wallets offer convenience while improving security, appealing to both new and experienced users by utilizing smart contracts to reduce dependence on private keys. * Additional features and security : Smart Wallets can support multi-signature transactions, add extra layers of security through app authentication, limit daily transaction amounts, and prevent potential errors or theft. Smart Wallet is incorporated in Trava Station and TravaGPT to optimize DeFi actions for users in Trava Finance. Specifically, with Trava Station, your assets are temporarily moved to a Smart Wallet to execute all your actions in a single transaction, making the process smoother. After the actions are completed, your assets are returned to your main wallet (like Metamask or Trust Wallet). To have your own Smart Wallet, you just need to connect your wallet to Trava Finance and go to the Freight tab of Trava Station to create it.

It is impossible to understand what money in reserves is actually there. Also what is the actual token circulation count? Coinmarketcap and Coingecko need updates on the token since the price is not tracked anymore. No way for investors to know what the value per token is based off of reserve assets. There should be a visually easy view of token reserves or investments along with their daily market price then divided amongst the circulation we now all know the value per token. I feel a team is needed just for this protocol and if there is one and that's all they do, then we need more folks. We also need more communication. My biggest fear for Trava capital it seems to be a blatant or obvious security or stock share the way it is designed now. Being from the USA I may not be allowed to trade these in the future unfortunately. Thats point, Team should not, skip this kinda situation, its looks bad on view, when tokens is just non tracked. Also we dont know how money left for investing, etc We need more partnership with project, some ama with other group/teams for marketing trava capital and trava token. @jefe811 said in IdeaContest--Lending Pool-Trava Knight-Trava Capital: Trava should use some of the transaction fees earned to complete monthly or quarterly burn of the original amount of minted Trava. This should stay in place permanently. This will only make the price of Trava more valuable. Thats not bad idea, for price token, but honestly i prefer keep money for marketing with others project/people ama's partnerships etc, in social media is silent, i had proposal fore crew 3 but aswell is silent about this idea, we dont have much retweets/likes on tt page compare for followers, dunno why.

PreviousTreasure MapNextFuture Scope Last updated 1 year ago', 'Trava Mini-Game Series: Published in 3 min readAug 25, 2022 Share Introduction To Fortune Mining To provide users with more services in the Trava Ecosystem, we have planned to implement the Trava minigame series. After the Trava Lottery and Battlehand, the next game — Fortune Mining, will be soon published on September 8th 2022. Introduction to fortune mining What is Fortune Mining? As mentioned, this is an important component of the Trava Minigame Series. The game is built on the well-known blockchain idea of the No-loss-rewards game, allowing participants to earn big prizes without worrying about losing their money. How does it work? So how exactly does Fortune Mining work? For more details, users first need to deposit their money into the Fortune Mining Pool. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm). That means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones. The benefit Fortune Mining brings to players. _No loss to worry about_: As the old saying goes, “More risk brings higher return.” However, with Fortune Mining, players will not need to worry about their losses. Because of the unique mechanism, there will be no loss, and unlucky players can get their deposits back after a certain period. _Big prize to look for_: While there is no loss to be concerned about, the winner may earn significantly more benefits than they would if they had deposited into the regular pool. For example , assuming that we run a Fortune Mining pool for users to deposit DAI and gain 20.000 DAI in total deposited after one week. With APY at 1.5% (that is converted to APR at about 0,92%) and APR at 4.08%, respectively, two weeks later, the total reward for the winner will be calculated as: _20000 (0.92%+ 4.08%)/365 14 = 38.356 DAI._ That means if you deposit 100 DAI at first and become the lucky one, you will receive about $38,356 (the interest rate at about 1000%) instead of $0,19 (the interest rate at about 5%). As in the example above, the gap between the rewards you could get in a normal pool and the Fortune Mining pool is very significant. For that reason, this mini-game will be a good choice for those with small capital to try their luck and get much more money than usual. To sum up, what do you need to do to attain the benefits? Step 1. Deposit your token into the Fortune Mining Pool Step 2. Waiting for a certain period (depending on each campaign) Step 3 . Check the result: * If you are the lucky one: Congratulations, you get all the rewards from the pool * If you have not been lucky yet, don’t worry, you can withdraw your deposit or keep them in the pool, then try your luck in the next period. Notes: We will soon run a voting snapshot for our community to decide which asset should be put in the Fortune Mining pool. Stay tuned for that.

The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation? : The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals. When do I need to repay the loan? : As long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan. However, the accrued interest of your borrowing will grow day by day, making your health factor decrease.

That is why Trava Finance tops up contracts running out of Tokens, like bridge, staking vaults, LP vaults, lending contracts, manually by setting up notification bots to alert relevant Team members to complete the top-up. Additionally, Team is constantly reading the latest news and hacks happening in Crypto Space and investigating contract code particularities which were the point of attack. Another point - Trava Finance does not support flash loans due to flash loan attack possibilities, but other projects like AAVE do support them. That is why we do not see TRAVA as an asset within Lending Pools as using other project protocols it could lead to TRAVA\'s Token price downfall if it were to be used in flash loan attack scheme.

Indeed having $TRAVA as an asset to be able to Lend/Borrow via Lending Pools would provide the necessary utility. However as @theunreal has mentioned above, TRAVA Token cannot be added as an asset to Lending Pools as of this moment at least due a few reasons. Trava Finance does not support flash loans in Lending Pools, but other project protocols like AAVE do. By staging a flash loan attack via other project protocols users could destroy TRAVA price like it happened with CREAM for example. Current low price, current low circulating supply does not allow TRAVA to be an asset in Lending Pools quite yet. But that is why TraDAO ($TOD) should take it\'s place in the near future as an asset to be available for Lend/Borrow since it\'s backed up by a Treasury controlled by TraDAO protocol itself. Kel 25 Apr 2022, 16:35 Latest posts made by Kel * RE: Idea Contest Discussion posted in Governance I would suggest to start with adjusting/changing/restructuring (idea 2.) the landing page and creating simple drop-down menu options with hyperlinks to different Trava Finance products like Trava Lending Pools; Trava Staking Vaults; Trava NFT Product; Trava Capital; Trava Governance etc. Also add a feature to manually stop or finish/end the 3D animation as there were reports of the animation not loading up. Creating a user-friendly landing page is one of the priorities for better user experience. Additionally, Trava Finance lending product team should start working on adding more tokens to ""Token Health"" so they could be added to pool creation once the product is 100% finished - having more tokens available for pool creation feature is an advantage to attract more userbase and investors. Lastly, I like the (idea 4.) - creating more DeFi investment options to explore in DeFi Cryptospace is great for expanding community knowledge about investment possibilities and also making the BRicher tool more flexible. Having more protocols/chains/networks to choose from can expand the use-case of the tool.

Unfortunately, we cannot comment on any potential exchange listing platform or timeline. What we can confirm is that negotiations are happening and new CEX listing is always in plans, but requires good market conditions and approvals from both parties first, the exchange and the project. Kraken Listing on Kraken Exchange is pretty much impossible, they do not list Tokens randomly and the asset count available is low compared to other exchanges plus most of them are 100 Top assets. Etoro Same as Kraken, the asset size list available for trading is low and only selected few are available. Again at least 100 Top Tokens. Gate Exchange could theoretically damage the price of TRAVA Token due to airdrops for their exchange users, which they dump immediately after event is completed, plus projects have to donate Tokens for this event. MEXC and Bitmart listing are a perfect example. Plus Gate is not that renown, there are better exchanges to look at. LBank Same logic as Gate. Binance and KuCoin These two exchanges are more likely to be on the list for the Trava Team to do negotiations with. Though listings on both exchanges are quite costly. But if I had to guess, these two exchanges are more likely to happen than any of the above.

While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA also offers the credit score function based on financial data on-chain analysis as a useful tool that reduces risk and increases profits for all users. We build our solutions on TRAVA.FINANCE whose smart contracts are deployed on BSC network, so the speed of transactions, gas fees, and robustness depend on BSC network. However, in the near future, we will allow cross-chain lending in our platform. Please join the the Trava team and members of the community look forward to helping you understand and use Trava. Why should we trust Trava? : Trava Protocol has been audited and secured internally, by third parties (Hacken, Certik) and even Community Checks. Check https://docs.trava.finance/security/ for more information. How to interconnect with Trava protocol? : In order to interconnect with Trava protocol, you need to deposit your asset into lending pools. After depositing, you will earn passive income, this income is based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, you can also borrow by using your deposited assets as collateral. Do I need to pay fees to interconnect with Trava protocol? : Interacting with the protocol requires transactions and so transaction fees for BSC Blockchain usage, which depend on the network status and transaction complexity. Where are my deposited tokens stored? : After depositing, your deposit funds are stored in a smart contract. The code of the smart contract is public, open-source, formally verified, and audited by third-party auditors. You can withdraw your funds from the pool back to your wallet. What does Trava do to avoid risk? : Risk can occur in smart contracts not only on BSC but also on other networks. To ensure the safe, we have several strategies as follows: * Auditing code performed by third parties: we have been audited by Hacken and Certik. We are contacting others. * Audit internally our code. We have a strong team with high-security skills. * Community check: we will organize hackathon events and reward programs that encourage the community to detect risks. What are the TRAVA token and its utility? : We issue TRAVA tokens based on Binance smart chain's BEP-20 standard; the total supply is 5 billion. These TRAVA tokens can be used in: * Reward: Pool owners can set up rewards paid by TRAVA token. Thus, lending pool depositors will earn rewards by TRAVA token. * Collateral and lending: Users can use TRAVA as mortgages. The users also loan TRAVA. * Payment for lending fees: Users can pay pool lending fees by TRAVA. * Payment for pool management: Pool owners can pay for the pool creation, update (e.g., pool parameters, add/remove tokens, …), and pause by TRAVA. * Payment for auction deposits: in the NFTs auction process, TRAVA can be used as a locked asset. * Payment for auction organization: To perform all auction actions for NFT, the NFT’s owners (auction organizers) can pay the auction fees by TRAVA. * Staking for a data validator: To store credit data stored on the knowledge graph chain, the data must be confirmed by validators. The process is built up to eliminate redundant, unnecessary, and insecure data. The knowledge graph data validators stake by TRAVA. * Staking to participate in the governance process: TRAVA.FINANCE will become a community solution, thus the TRAVA.FINANCE’s rules are elected by participants, who hold TRAVA’s token. Tokenomics? : Documentation on tokenomics and governance is available in the White Paper Does Trava have a Mobile App? : Be careful, we don’t provide any downloaded applications for mobile. Trava also never carries advertisements on any social media or search engine. Please stay away from those adverts if you see, it is a scam. In addition, Trava Protocol would not ask for your seed passphrase ever.

It means you would be no longer entitled to the potential upside value gain. Whereas, by borrowing, you can still obtain these potential earnings (working capital) without losing your asset. You can borrow when unexpected expenses happen and leverage your holding assets for other investment opportunities. How to borrow? : In order to borrow, you need to deposit any asset to be used as collateral first (check out the Depositing & Earning FAQ section for more info). After depositing, you simply go to the “Borrow” section and click the “Borrow” button on the asset you want to borrow. Input the amount and approve the transaction. The borrowed amount is based on the available deposits that you used as collateral. What is the maximum amount can I borrow? : The maximum amount you can borrow depends on your deposited value and the available liquidity. Please notice the health factor and liquidation threshold indicators to guarantee your collaterals are in the state of safety. Besides, you can not borrow if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor is too low. What type of asset do I repay my loans? : When repaying a loan, the type of asset that you need to repay is in the same asset you borrowed. For example, if you borrow 1 BNB you will pay back 1 BNB plus interest accrued. Another way to pay back the loan is using your collateral. If you want to pay back the loan based on USD price you can borrow any of the available stable coins as USDC, DAI, USDT, etc. How much interest would I pay for my loans? : When borrowing, the interest rate you need to pay depends on the borrowing rate which is determined from the supply and demand ratio of the asset. Moreover, the interest rate is a variable rate so that it changes constantly. The current borrowing rate of your borrowed assets is shown in the Borrowing section of your dashboard, you can check it any time. What is Health factor? : Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation? : The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals. When do I need to repay the loan? : As long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan. However, the accrued interest of your borrowing will grow day by day, making your health factor decrease. When it reaches the threshold of liquidation, your deposited assets are more likely to fall into liquidation status. How to repay the loan? : In order to pay back the loan you go to the Borrowings section of your dashboard and click on the repay button for the asset you borrowed and want to repay. Select the amount to pay back and approve the transaction.

The Utilisation Rate determines the borrow interest rates. : Each token in each Pool has a utilization rate at each time , which is defined by the ratio =/U_t = L_t/A_twhere represents total borrows and represents total liquidity. This ratio regulates how much of a deposited token is used in the market. When this ratio approaches 100%, there will be a scarcity of tokens in the Pool. The borrower will be unable to borrow at this time, and the lender will be unable to withdraw funds from the Pool. To avoid this, interest rate and risk parameters must be calculated in precise detail for each token. Interest Rate Model: Interest Rate Model tends to be a cost-effective way for the Pool to run itself. The parameters of the pool will aid in the adjustment of borrow and deposit rates to a balanced and reasonable point. In practice, numerous models are used: linear rate, non-linear rate, and kinked rate. The kinked rate model is used in the Trava protocol. As with the non-linear model, such models have the virtue of significantly shifting the incentives for borrowers and lenders beyond some usage level. In contrast to non-linear models without a kink, they also introduce a point of abrupt change in the interest rate, beyond which interest rates begin to sharply rise. The kinked model is based on several parameters and is described as follows. Firstly, the ratio optimal utilization rate UoptimalU_\\text{optimal}Uoptimal\u200b is a parameter that determines the best-fit utilization rate for the protocol. It varies from token to token and depends on the risk and volatility of the token. For example, it could be 80% for stable tokens like DAI, or just 65% for unstable coins like LINK. Next, the interest rate is a function that varies based on utilization rate. Three parameters are used to define this function: (1) Initial rate , (2) the constant Rslope1R_\\text{slope1}Rslope1\u200b is used when UoptimalU_t < U_\\text{optimal}Uoptimal\u200b, and (3) the constant Rslope2R_\\text{slope2}Rslope2\u200b is used when ≥UoptimalU_t \\geq U_\\text{optimal}Uoptimal\u200b. Specifically, the interest rate is defined by: * If UoptimalU_t <U_\\text{optimal}Uoptimal\u200b then =+Uoptimal×Rslope1R_t = R_0 + \\frac{U_t}{U_\\text{optimal}} \\times R_\\text{slope1}Uoptimal\u200b\u200b×Rslope1\u200b * If ≥UoptimalU_t \\geq U_\\text{optimal}Uoptimal\u200b then =+Rslope1+−Uoptimal1−Uoptimal×Rslope2R_t= R_0 + R_\\text{slope1} + \\frac{ U_t - U_\\text{optimal}}{1 -U_\\text{optimal}} \\times R_\\text{slope2}Rslope1\u200b+1−Uoptimal\u200b−Uoptimal\u200b\u200b×Rslope2\u200b The interest rates have a kink in them: they sharply change at a certain point. A variety of protocols use interest rates like this, including Aave and Compound. As users mint, redeem, borrow, repay, or liquidate tokens, the interest rate changes with the utilization rate . As a result, it's also known as a variable interest rate. Interest rate parameters in Trava protocol: Token Uoptimal Base Slope1 Slope2 DAI 80% 75% USDC 90% 60% USDT 90% 60% ETH 65% 100% BNB 65% 10% 100% BUSD 80% 100% BTCB 65% 100% AAVE 65% 100% ADA 65% 100% CAKE 65% 100% XRP 65% 100% DOGE 60% 150% DOT 65% 100% XVS 65% 100% FTM 65% 100% Borrow rate: The borrow rate is calculated using the current interest rate(per year) and is updated every second. That is, borrowers will be charged interest that changes every second. He must pay more interest if the Utilisation Rate is higher, and vice versa. Mathematically, at each time t, the Borrow rate (per second) is =/YB_t = R_t/Y where Y=31536000Y= 3153600031536000 is the number of seconds in a year. If the user is currently borrowing tokens then the interest payable is ×T_t \\times B_t . The interest payable is accrued to the loan in the next second, that is T=(1+)T_{t+1}=T_t(1+B_t) . Deposit rate: Deposit rate and Borrow rate are closely linked. Precisely, at each time , deposit rate is determined based on Utilization Rate and borrow rate and reserve factor . Precisely, deposit rate is defined by =××(1−r)D_t = U_t \\times B_t\\times (1-r). In terms of probability, is probability that each token is borrowed, thus is the average value of interest earned from each token deposited into the Pool.

Idea: Starting from TraDAO and turning into Trava Capital, its growth is closely connected to our community. Correspondingly, when technology reaches another high and the market is in a bullish phase with many opportunities awaiting, it’s time for renovation and innovation. Therefore, our team has discussed carefully and had the first thoughts about the updates we can make with Trava Capital. We intend to separate it from Trava Finance into its own being — an AI platform that enables running liquidity provision strategies on blockchains. But no matter which direction we go, our ultimate goal is still to benefit users and the entire Trava ecosystem. Our community is always the center. 2. Information: Trava Capital is an important pillar of our ecosystem, which currently provides users with two main investment models — Treasury and Crowdfunding. It has been and is still bringing benefits to the community, however, our team foresees its even brighter future. Our goal is to build a trustless market-making infrastructure & strategies on DEX V3, as well as Lending pool on multi-chains, with the integration of AI technology. From there, Liquidity providers can utilize our features to have their liquidity managed in an automated, capital-efficient, non-custodial, and transparent manner. We hope to democratize market-making, enabling DEXs and Lending to become the primary trading venue for all assets, even beyond crypto. 3. Ask for Suggestions: During this initial ideation stage, the features we can propose include: * Multiple Concentrated Liquidity Positions * Cross-fee tier Vaults * Inventory Management * Non-Custodial * … and more. So what do you think about this new renovation and innovation plan for Trava Capital? With the new goal of becoming an AI platform that enables running liquidity provision strategies on blockchains as mentioned above, what features do you think we should add?"", 'TRAVA is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending.

']","[""Introduction: In borrowing, when a borrowers’ health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value, a liquidation process might happen. In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty? : The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated? : In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level.

Firstly, one Minor and Two Informational Issues concern some coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused functions, missing zero addresses checking, and function type. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues. Secondly, all four Major Issues are related to Centralization. The owners of the following contracts below can execute some functions without obtaining the consensus of the community: * FactoryRegistry, * AddressesProviderFactory * PoolUpdateControl * LendingPoolConfigurator Certik Recommendations for the Centralization Issue:: Certik advised to carefully manage the governance/guardian account’s private key to avoid any potential risks of being hacked. In general, Certik strongly recommended centralized privileges or roles in the protocol to be improved via a decentralized mechanism or via smart-contract-based accounts with enhanced security practices, e.g. Multisignature wallets. Some feasible solutions recommended by Certik that would also mitigate the potential risk include: * Time-lock with reasonable latency, i.e. 48 hours, for awareness on privileged operations; * Assignment of privileged roles to multi-signature wallets to prevent a single point of failure due to the private key; * Introduction of a DAO/governance/voting module to increase transparency and user involvement. Trava Solutions for the Centralization Issue: Trava has partially resolved these issues via smart-contract-based accounts. In particular: * Deploy a Multi-Signature wallet in BSC mainnet at the address: 0xdF73aC573Dfd430f4C5558B8CbeD86e86145501B * Set up the owner of the contracts and governance to the multi-signature wallet. Although these issues are major, our approach can avoid the potential risks of centralization. Moreover, in our roadmap, we will enable DAO Functionalities in Q2–2022. The introduction of the DAO module will completely resolve the centralization issues. This approach will make our community control the process and activity of Trava Finance in the near future.

In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool.

Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion.

Borrow The activity of borrowing tokens from the lending pool. : Borrow rate A proportion of the borrowed amount borrowers need to pay the lenders every second. Borrowers Who borrow digital assets with different interest rates, liquidity mining, and levels of risk. C: Collateral The cryptocurrency asset used by the borrower serves as a promise to repay the loan. Contract collector A collector contract is a smart contract that receives a share of the protocol's interest allocated from the reserve factor. Cross-chain lending A new type of lending that allows users to deposit and borrow digital assets spread across multiple blockchains. D: Deposit The activity of depositing tokens into the lending pool. Deposit rate A proportion of the amount lent that lenders receive from the borrowers every second. H: Health Factor The numeric representation of the safety of deposited assets against the borrowed assets and their underlying value. I: Interest rate An interest rate is the amount of interest due per period as a proportion of the amount lent, deposited, or borrowed. In the Trava Lending pool, the interest rate is designed to control liquidity risk while also maximizing utilization. L: Lenders Who play the role of liquidity providers in lending pools in the Trava Ecosystem. Liquidation penalty A liquidation penalty is a bonus applied to the price of collateral assets purchased by liquidators as part of the liquidation of a loan that has reached the liquidation threshold. Liquidation Threshold The percentage at which a position is defined as undercollateralized. For example, a Liquidation threshold of 80% means that if the value rises above 80% of the collateral, the position is undercollateralized and could be liquidated. LTV (Loan-to-Value) A financial term used by lenders to express the ratio of a loan to the value of an asset purchased. M: Maximum LTV The maximum amount of currency that can be borrowed with specific collateral. N: NET APY The Net APY shows the APY over all assets deposited and borrowed. NFT-Collateralization A function that allows Trava Knight NFTs to be used as collateral in the Trava Lending pool. P: Pool owners (For pool creation) When the Trava Pool Creation is implemented, users may easily and quickly start their own lending businesses as pool owners. In more specific terms, they might construct lending pools with digital assets of varying risk levels, which are now only available in the Trava Ecosystem. R: Repay loan The activity of paying back money previously borrowed from the lending pool. Reserve Factor The reserve factor allocates a share of the protocol's interests to a collector contract as a reserve for the ecosystem. Reserve size The amount of a particular cryptocurrency asset held in the lending pool. Risk parameters Parameters are set for each asset to avoid the risk and maintain the sustainable development of the lending pool, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, Reserve factor, etc. rTRAVA The reward token you receive from borrowing, depositing in the Trava Lending pool, and farming in the Heuristic program (Trava Knight NFT). The $rTRAVA is pegged to the $TRAVA, with a conversion rate of 1:1. T: Total Borrowed The total amount of a particular asset borrowed in the lending pool. Total Deposited The total amount of a particular asset deposited in the lending pool. Transaction fee A transaction fee is paid when a certain amount of cryptocurrency is transferred from one wallet to another. Trava Finance marketplace A platform that combines the Trava lending pool and multiple user-owned pools for the goals of borrowing and lending assets. Trava Pool Creation The goal of Trava Finance as allowing users to create and manage their own pools to start a lending business to generate a total decentralized marketplace. TVL (Total value locked) TVL is the total value held in the Trava Lending pool. U: User-owned pools The lending pools which are created and managed by users. Utilization rate Each token in each Pool has a utilization rate at each time, which is defined by the ratio that represents total borrows and represents total liquidity. This ratio regulates how much of a deposited token is used in the market. W: Withdraw The activity of taking back tokens from the lending pool to users' wallets.

While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrowing/lending interest rate, liquidity threshold, Loan to Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA.FINANCE offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA.FINANCE is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks. The pool owners, who are an additional role to lenders and borrowers, can receive more earnings by devising a good lending strategy for their pools. Moreover, to reduce risks and stimulate lending and borrowing, TRAVA.FINANCE performs cross-chain data analysis on multiple blockchain networks to (i) recommend optimal pool parameters for pool owners and (ii) detect unusual transactions in their pools. The lending marketplace model of TRAVA.FINANCE will increase crypto liquidity and promote the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. There are six salient features of TRAVA.FINANCE, including: * **Crypto lending marketplace** : TRAVA.FINANCE creates a **marketplace** in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and obtain greater earnings. * **Semantic knowledge graph** : TRAVA.FINANCE is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA.FINANCE to efficiently search for useful information such as (i) the amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses; (ii) the provenance of an NFT; (iii) aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc. * **Data analysis** : To reduce lending risks, TRAVA.FINANCE performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA.FINANCE recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, Loan to Value ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA.FINANCE also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools. * **Credit score evaluation** : Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can (i) reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool; and (ii) stimulate borrowing by defining a high Loan to Value ratio for borrowers with high credit scores. * **Cross-chain identification and cross-chain lending** : TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross- chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores. * **NFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals** : To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA.FINANCE allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn considerable amounts from the contract.

What is users’ credit score? : In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. What benefits does credit score brings to users? : -For borrowers, the primary benefit is that they can borrow with a ""preferential interest rate"" if their credit score is high. They can also receive higher loan-to-value-ratio compared to other users For lenders, who have high credit scores easily become LPs of different pools. Moreover, when they create a pool, their pool will have a higher credit score because the pool creator\'s credit score is also a criterion for the pool scoring. Especially, pool owners can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. How Credit scores for wallet addresses are calculated? : To evaluate credit scores for wallet addresses, TRAVA credit scoring model will take into account 5 factors: 1. Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address. 2. Transaction history: TRAVA aggregates all transactions of a wallet address across all platforms to calculate various parameters such as (i) transaction amount, (ii) number of liquidations, etc. 3. Loans ratio: represents the debt position of an account, including the Loan-to-balance ratio and Loan-to-investment ratio. 4. Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. 5. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range. The z-score is calculated from the mean and the standard deviation from every corresponding parameter of all accounts. To be more specific, you can read this function in TRAVA whitepaper. How the user\'s credit score will be updated? : Our system has both periodic updates and instant updates. The instant update occurs when users actively make transactions such as deposit, withdraw, repay... Or when users view their credit score on our app. In case a user has not viewed their credit score and had no transactions for a long time, their credit score is still updated periodically and automatically, which can be weekly or monthly. We are still trying to optimize it. Which objects does Trava evaluate credit score for? : At the moment, Trava has been evaluating the credit scores for 3 types of Objects: Wallet addresses (users), tokens, and NFTs. How to increase my credit score? : To improve the credit score of your wallet, you would need to take into account our five parameters, i.e., Total asset, Transaction history, Loans ratios, Circulating assets, and Trustworthiness of possessing assets. For instance, you should increase your wallet balance with prestige coins and tokens, perform more transactions and become more active in the crypto market, maintaining good Loan-to-balance and Loan-to-investment ratios, supply more liquidity to lending pools, trade on lending DApps to earn as much profit as you can, avoid collateral liquidation while borrowing, and possess at least $1000 valuable token (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, or BNB). Besides, you need to be credible users for a long time. It is because to avoid fraud, TRAVA calculates some credit score parameters based on their average values in the last k days, where k depends on the volatility of the crypto market. Moreover, some parameters are assessed based on the “standardized score” function, which calculates the mean and the standard deviation of all accounts’ parameters. Thus, trying to be the best at some criteria would improve your credit score too. Why did my credit score decrease? : The reasons why your credit score drops might be: You have bad transactions such as borrowing liquidations, your balance decrease, your borrowing rate is higher, you are not active enough, etc...You can read our white paper to understand how the credit score mechanism functions. https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/credit-score-evaluation PreviousTroubleshootingNextNFTs Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?', 'PreviousBRicher User GuideNextveTRAVA Marketplace User Guide Last updated 1 year ago Was this helpful?', 'A: Age of the wallet (day) The period that the wallet has participated in the crypto market since its first transaction.

Once being used as collaterals, they offer high loan-to-value ratios to borrowers; lenders also get favorable lending interest rates with their high-credit-score tokens. Users can improve their credit scores once they possess those high-valuable digital assets.']","['In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. TRAVA.FINANCE uses credit scores to ensure the safety of the lending process. Pool owners and lenders can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. Based on the credit scores, they can determine the maximum Loan-To-Value ratio for borrowers. Borrowers with high credit scores get preferential treatment; they can borrow cryptos with more favorable interest rates and Loan-To-Value ratios. Credit scores provide an incentive for users to (i) hold their wallet addresses as long as possible and keep them clean, (ii) perform the cross-chain identification protocol to interlink their addresses, (iii) perform more transactions inside and outside TRAVA.FINANCE, and so on. This increases crypto liquidity and fosters the growth of the DeFi system. The credit score evaluation in TRAVA.FINANCE is primarily based on on-chain data. At present, we collect, enrich, and analyze Binance Smart Chain transactions, including the native transferring transactions and the transactions to deposit, withdraw, repay, and borrow tokens generated from Binance Smart Chain lending DApps. TRAVA.FINANCE evaluates credit scores for both wallet addresses and other digital assets. Wallet addresses operated for a long time with good transaction history (e.g., an address that has transactions with many other addresses, always pays debts on time, and performs transactions frequently) will have a high credit score. Pool owners can use credit scores as a criterion to select competent wallet addresses for their pool’s liquidity providers. The credit rating of digital assets helps pool owners and liquid providers to minimize liquidity risk. TRAVA.FINANCE divides digital assets into two categories: Tokens/coins and other digital assets (e.g., NFT, smart contracts, stoke tokens) and evaluates their credit scores. The credit score of a **Token** is assessed based on 4 parameters, i.e., (i) the token price, (ii) the market cap (MC) of the token, (iii) the token trading volume, and (iv) the number of transactions related to the token. High-credit-score tokens have a great advantage over low-credit-score tokens. Once being used as collaterals, they offer high loan-to-value ratios to borrowers; lenders also get favorable lending interest rates with their high-credit-score tokens. Users can improve their credit scores once they possess those high-valuable digital assets. TRAVA.FINANCE also performs credit ratings for other **digital assets such as NFT**. The credit scores for NFTs are estimated based on the number of times that they have been auctioned on TRAVA.FINANCE or other trusted platforms. NFTs’ scores should not depend on their price because their price is typically determined in an unreliable manner, based on the emotion and the preference of customers. To evaluate credit scores for a wallet address, TRAVA.FINANCE credit scoring model will take into account the following factors: * _Total asset_. The total asset represents the financial strength of the wallet address; it is the most intuitive and easiest-to-evaluate parameter. It is also the second most important parameter that affects credit scores. The total asset is the sum of balance and total investment minus total liabilities. The credit score of the address is proportional to its total asset. As this parameter is a volatility index, the credit score is calculated based on both the _average total asset_ in a certain period and the _total current asset_. * _Transaction history_. Transaction history is the most important parameter; it has a major impact on credit scores. TRAVA.FINANCE collects and aggregates all exchanges, loans, deposits, and other transactions of the wallet address across multiple DApps to calculate various intermediate parameters such as (i) the age of the address, (ii) its transaction amount, (iii) its frequency of transaction, (iv) its number of liquidations and (v) its total value of liquidations. * _Loan ratios_. Loan ratios (debt ratios) represent the debt position of the account. It is divided into two sub-parameters, i.e., loan-to-balance ratio and loan-to-investment ratio. * _Circulating assets_. This parameter represents how active users are in the crypto market. The more money they invest in the crypto market, the more creditworthiness they gain from others. This parameter is evaluated based on 2 sub-parameters, (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE (Return on equity). * _Trustworthiness of possessing assets_. The last parameter for credit rating is the trustworthiness of the assets owned by the wallet address. The wallet can improve its credit score by possessing high-value and trustworthy digital assets. At present, TRAVA.FINANCE evaluates two types of digital assets only (i.e, Token and NFT).

What is users’ credit score? : In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. What benefits does credit score brings to users? : -For borrowers, the primary benefit is that they can borrow with a ""preferential interest rate"" if their credit score is high. They can also receive higher loan-to-value-ratio compared to other users For lenders, who have high credit scores easily become LPs of different pools. Moreover, when they create a pool, their pool will have a higher credit score because the pool creator\'s credit score is also a criterion for the pool scoring. Especially, pool owners can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. How Credit scores for wallet addresses are calculated? : To evaluate credit scores for wallet addresses, TRAVA credit scoring model will take into account 5 factors: 1. Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address. 2. Transaction history: TRAVA aggregates all transactions of a wallet address across all platforms to calculate various parameters such as (i) transaction amount, (ii) number of liquidations, etc. 3. Loans ratio: represents the debt position of an account, including the Loan-to-balance ratio and Loan-to-investment ratio. 4. Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. 5. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range. The z-score is calculated from the mean and the standard deviation from every corresponding parameter of all accounts. To be more specific, you can read this function in TRAVA whitepaper. How the user\'s credit score will be updated? : Our system has both periodic updates and instant updates. The instant update occurs when users actively make transactions such as deposit, withdraw, repay... Or when users view their credit score on our app. In case a user has not viewed their credit score and had no transactions for a long time, their credit score is still updated periodically and automatically, which can be weekly or monthly. We are still trying to optimize it. Which objects does Trava evaluate credit score for? : At the moment, Trava has been evaluating the credit scores for 3 types of Objects: Wallet addresses (users), tokens, and NFTs. How to increase my credit score? : To improve the credit score of your wallet, you would need to take into account our five parameters, i.e., Total asset, Transaction history, Loans ratios, Circulating assets, and Trustworthiness of possessing assets. For instance, you should increase your wallet balance with prestige coins and tokens, perform more transactions and become more active in the crypto market, maintaining good Loan-to-balance and Loan-to-investment ratios, supply more liquidity to lending pools, trade on lending DApps to earn as much profit as you can, avoid collateral liquidation while borrowing, and possess at least $1000 valuable token (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, or BNB). Besides, you need to be credible users for a long time. It is because to avoid fraud, TRAVA calculates some credit score parameters based on their average values in the last k days, where k depends on the volatility of the crypto market. Moreover, some parameters are assessed based on the “standardized score” function, which calculates the mean and the standard deviation of all accounts’ parameters. Thus, trying to be the best at some criteria would improve your credit score too. Why did my credit score decrease? : The reasons why your credit score drops might be: You have bad transactions such as borrowing liquidations, your balance decrease, your borrowing rate is higher, you are not active enough, etc...You can read our white paper to understand how the credit score mechanism functions. https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/credit-score-evaluation PreviousTroubleshootingNextNFTs Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?', 'A: Age of the wallet (day) The period that the wallet has participated in the crypto market since its first transaction.

What is users’ credit score? : In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. What benefits does credit score brings to users? : -For borrowers, the primary benefit is that they can borrow with a ""preferential interest rate"" if their credit score is high. They can also receive higher loan-to-value-ratio compared to other users For lenders, who have high credit scores easily become LPs of different pools. Moreover, when they create a pool, their pool will have a higher credit score because the pool creator\'s credit score is also a criterion for the pool scoring. Especially, pool owners can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. How Credit scores for wallet addresses are calculated? : To evaluate credit scores for wallet addresses, TRAVA credit scoring model will take into account 5 factors: 1. Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address. 2. Transaction history: TRAVA aggregates all transactions of a wallet address across all platforms to calculate various parameters such as (i) transaction amount, (ii) number of liquidations, etc. 3. Loans ratio: represents the debt position of an account, including the Loan-to-balance ratio and Loan-to-investment ratio. 4. Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. 5. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range. The z-score is calculated from the mean and the standard deviation from every corresponding parameter of all accounts. To be more specific, you can read this function in TRAVA whitepaper. How the user\'s credit score will be updated? : Our system has both periodic updates and instant updates. The instant update occurs when users actively make transactions such as deposit, withdraw, repay... Or when users view their credit score on our app. In case a user has not viewed their credit score and had no transactions for a long time, their credit score is still updated periodically and automatically, which can be weekly or monthly. We are still trying to optimize it. Which objects does Trava evaluate credit score for? : At the moment, Trava has been evaluating the credit scores for 3 types of Objects: Wallet addresses (users), tokens, and NFTs. How to increase my credit score? : To improve the credit score of your wallet, you would need to take into account our five parameters, i.e., Total asset, Transaction history, Loans ratios, Circulating assets, and Trustworthiness of possessing assets. For instance, you should increase your wallet balance with prestige coins and tokens, perform more transactions and become more active in the crypto market, maintaining good Loan-to-balance and Loan-to-investment ratios, supply more liquidity to lending pools, trade on lending DApps to earn as much profit as you can, avoid collateral liquidation while borrowing, and possess at least $1000 valuable token (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, or BNB). Besides, you need to be credible users for a long time. It is because to avoid fraud, TRAVA calculates some credit score parameters based on their average values in the last k days, where k depends on the volatility of the crypto market. Moreover, some parameters are assessed based on the “standardized score” function, which calculates the mean and the standard deviation of all accounts’ parameters. Thus, trying to be the best at some criteria would improve your credit score too.

How to attend Trava NFT Auction?,0.9873,True,"['Rules Auction is ONLY cancellable when it has NO BIDS. After the first bid comes in, neither you nor we can cancel it, as rules are written in the smart contract. When the bidding countdown is less than 5 minutes left, every new bid will extend the countdown by 5 minutes; Each bid price will be increased by at least 5% of the previous one. Once the countdown ends, the auction item will be obtained by the last/highest bidder; The most important rule: 2.5% of the price increase for each bid is distributed to the previous bidder, and the remaining 97.5% would be the income of the auction publisher if it’s the last bid or returned to the bidder when it’s outbid. With the rules, each bidder would either take the 5% share of the next bid or obtain the auction Knight with the price he/she offered. And the first bidder will additionally be free from distributing his/her own 5% to other people. Note: The percentage that the later bidder pays for the earlier bidder is the same as the percentage that the sellers need to pay for the platform. So, 2.5% is also the amount auction publishers pay to the marketplace, which means that after receiving 97.5% of the final bidding price as income, sellers need to pay 2.5% of the income to the NFT marketplace. Therefore, the final payment rate that the sellers receive is 95.06% of the final bid. This fee is utilized for marketing, operating, and functioning.

Secondly, Billy offered 1100 TRAVA ⇒ Alice would receive her own 1000 TRAVA and 2.5% of 1100 TRAVA, which would be 1027.5 TRAVA in total, and the extra 27.5 TRAVA is totally free money. Finally, Michael offered 1200 TRAVA. ⇒ Then, Billy would get 97.5% of his 1100 TRAVA and 2.5% of 1200 TRAVA, that is 1102.5 TRAVA, still getting 30 TRAVA for free. ⇒ The auction publisher will receive ~ 95.06% of the final bidding price (1200 TRAVA). Therefore, the seller will receive ~ 1140.72 TRAVA and pay 29.25 TRAVA to the platform.

Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract. How does Trava price NFTs? : Trava will provide the auction function for NFT assets. Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way. We also avoid the price fluctuation of NFT because the NFTs have been priced in the auction contract before. What can I do with NFTs after the auction? : TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT. Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.

After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back. The auction process is as follows: 1. The NFT owner opens an auction session; she sets (i) the legal crypto used in the auction, (ii) the initial price for her NFT, (iii) the countdown time for the auction session, (iv) the mode for her auction (i.e., _auction-to-sell or auction-for-buy-right_), and other auction terms. 2. TRAVA.FINANCE users, who are interested in the NFT, can join in the auction session. To encourage users to participate in auctions, at the end of the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE randomly selects several bidders and rewards them with TRAVA tokens extracted from the auction fees. To guarantee that the bidders make their payment when they win the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE locks a number of their TRAVA tokens as soon as they join in the auction session and make a bid. When the auction finishes, they will immediately get their tokens back if they are not the winner. In case they are the winners, they can get their tokens back only if they pay for the auctioning NFT before the deadline. 3. In the _auction-to-sell_ mode, the auction winner will pay the owner the whole auction price to get the NFT. 4. In the _auction-for-buy-right_ mode, the auction winners have to pay a part of the auction price. We name the quotient of the amount the winners have to pay over the auction price ""_auction-paid ratio_ ”. The auction-paid ratio is calculated from the creditworthiness of the lender, borrower, NFT, and the auction terms. The NFT owners can use the cryptos paid by the auction winner as collateral for their loans. Once they repay their loan including the interest to the auction winners, they can get the NFT back. Otherwise, they will lose their NFT to the auction winners. These rules are all defined in the auction smart contract. TRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below. * **NFT owners** can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it. TRAVA.FINANCE thus increases the liquidity of NFTs and opens up a unique and exciting NFTFi marketplace. * Based on the given number of auction bids, **bidders** have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session. This rewarding mechanism provides incentives for users to actively make a bid in the auction. * **Auction winners** can get their desired NFT at a price lower than their bidding price (once NFT owners cannot repay the loan) or they can receive considerable interest from their loan to NFT owners (once NFT owners repay the loans and get their NFT back). * The credit scores of **NFT owners, auction winners, bidders,** and **NFTs** can be improved after auctions.

What are benefit for those who participate in the Trava Knight auction?,0.9299,True,"['Benefit for those who participate in the Trava Knight auction Benefit for auction publishers (the sellers) Auction publishers (or sellers) are those who open auctions for their Knights. Opening an auction allows auction publishers to set up their price floor for their Knights, which determines their minimum desired price, helping them avoid selling their Knights at an unwanted low price compared to the market price. The auction opens a great opportunity for Knight owners to make profits without the need of disassembling their Knights to pieces and selling each item multiple times, which can cause wasted gas fees due to multiple transactions. Benefit for bidders Trava Knight auction is of benefit for bidders since it offers them the opportunity to get the full Knight, not every piece of armoury NFT on Trava NFT Marketplace. This helps bidders save more time in obtaining a Knight without finding and collecting armoury items to assemble. The auction also offers bidders an excellent method to get their favorable Knights, which suits their needs for missions such as Farming, Expedition, Farming with EXP and PvP tournaments in the future. Benefit for Trava Lending Pool The NFT Auction is the first step toward Trava Finance’s long-term aim of allowing NFTs to be used as collateral in the Trava Lending pool. By using an auction mechanism, the NFT will be priced and subsequently used as collateral in the Trava loan pool. This is a good method to vary the collaterals and give users more opportunities to lend assets.  ', 'Benefits of Knight NFTs Each of Knight and Armory NFTs represents a unique digital collectible that can be bought, sold, rented and put on auction on Trava Knight NFT Marketplace. It helps increase the utility of not only NFTs for NFT-collateralization, but also $TRAVA in our system as all the trading on the Marketplace is in $TRAVA. Users can assemble Knight NFTs to join Trava Farming Programs (NFT Farming, Heuristic Farming) in different vaults for a great APY — the rarer the NFT, the higher APY. The longer staked in the vaults, Loyal Knight NFT holders will also have more benefits in our lending pool in the future.

In case they are the winners, they can get their tokens back only if they pay for the auctioning NFT before the deadline. 3. In the _auction-to-sell_ mode, the auction winner will pay the owner the whole auction price to get the NFT. 4. In the _auction-for-buy-right_ mode, the auction winners have to pay a part of the auction price. We name the quotient of the amount the winners have to pay over the auction price ""_auction-paid ratio_ ”. The auction-paid ratio is calculated from the creditworthiness of the lender, borrower, NFT, and the auction terms. The NFT owners can use the cryptos paid by the auction winner as collateral for their loans. Once they repay their loan including the interest to the auction winners, they can get the NFT back. Otherwise, they will lose their NFT to the auction winners. These rules are all defined in the auction smart contract. TRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below. * **NFT owners** can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it. TRAVA.FINANCE thus increases the liquidity of NFTs and opens up a unique and exciting NFTFi marketplace. * Based on the given number of auction bids, **bidders** have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session. This rewarding mechanism provides incentives for users to actively make a bid in the auction. * **Auction winners** can get their desired NFT at a price lower than their bidding price (once NFT owners cannot repay the loan) or they can receive considerable interest from their loan to NFT owners (once NFT owners repay the loans and get their NFT back). * The credit scores of **NFT owners, auction winners, bidders,** and **NFTs** can be improved after auctions. The auction mechanism for NFT can also be applied to any type of digital asset. In our road map, TRAVA.FINANCE will implement this auction feature for various types of digital assets (e.g., stock token, smart contract).

Trava Knight NFT is the first step on our path to reach our goal of NFT-collateralization in our lending pool system. NextAbout us Last updated 1 year ago', ""Does Trava apply NFTs in the ecosystem? : Yes, TRAVA allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract. How does Trava price NFTs? : Trava will provide the auction function for NFT assets. Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way. We also avoid the price fluctuation of NFT because the NFTs have been priced in the auction contract before. What can I do with NFTs after the auction? : TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT. Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.

What is EXP points and how to earn them?,0.9748,True,"['EXP points At the moment, EXP (Experience Point) is the point that shows how long an Armoury NFT is staked in our vaults. EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault. Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault We’ve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items). You can see your EXP  either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace.    Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs. However, when you withdraw your Knight NFT, disassemble and reassemble with different items to get another Knight NFT, your Armoury NFTs will have different EXPs.  ']","['Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information). :', ""The Trade-Up Mechanism allows NFT owners to combine multiple identical Armoury NFTs of the same rarity and the same type into a single higher rarity Armoury NFT of the same type. For example, multiple Silver Helmets can be traded up to a Gold Helmet. The idea of Trade-Up Mechanism is that NFT owners will be given a great opportunity to take advantage of their unused NFTs and then level up them to the higher rarity. With higher rarity, NFT owners can assemble items into Knight NFTs of higher rarity and farm them for a higher APR, allowing them to gain bigger profits. Moreover, the high rarity of the NFT will bring its owner a huge advantage in Auction mechanism in the future. In the meantime, our Trade-up Mechanism will help us solve the problem of redundancy of idle NFTs as we issue more chests. 4 Armoury NFTs of the same rarity and type will be assembled into a single NFT of higher rarity and the same type. The success rate of trading up will be based on a base rate, and increase with EXP. * Success: A new NFT with higher rarity will be minted and transferred to the wallet of the user. In the meantime, four ingredient Armoury NFTs will be burnt. Furthermore, regardless of how much EXP the four burned NFTs had gained, the EXP of the new NFT will be 0. * Failure: Users will only receive back three out of four ingredient NFTs, with the lowest EXP NFT being burned. In our Trade-up Mechanism, each rarity has a failure rate called _baseFailureRate_ and a failure time threshold called _timeBase_. Moreover, the failure rate will be determined by the total EXP of all Armoury NFTs which are selected to do trade-up, this EXP is referred to as _collectiveEXP_. The EXP of selected Armoury NFTs is inversely proportional to the failure rate, which means that the higher the total EXP of selected NFTs, the lower the failure rate. If all 4 NFT pieces don't have any experience point, the failure rate is equal to the base failure rate. **Trade-up** **Copper → Silver** **Silver → Gold** **Gold → Diamond** **Diamond → Crystal** **Failure Rate** 50% 60% 70% 80% **Time Base** 8 days 20 days 64 days 200 days collectiveEXP=exp(nft1)+exp(nft2)+exp(nft3)+exp(nft4) collectiveEXP = exp(nft1) + exp(nft2) + exp(nft3) + exp(nft4)collectiveEXP=exp(nft1)+exp(nft2)+exp(nft3)+exp(nft4) The formula for failure rate will be calculated as belows: Where, * _RFP: Relative Fail Percent_ * _b: Base Failure Rate_ * _x: Collective Experience of Ingredients_ * _t: Time Base of Rarity_ _If x = 0 then RFP = b_ _If x < t then RFP = b * k, k > 50%_ _If x = t then RFP = b * 0.5_ _If x > t then RFP = b * k, k < 50%_ For example: All 4 NFTs are Diamond Weapons and have different EXP, respectively: * NFT 1: 1000000 EXP * NFT 2: 2000000 EXP * NFT 3: 3500000 EXP * NFT 4: 2500000 EXP => x = 1000000 + 2000000 + 1500000 + 500000 = 9000000 EXP t = 200*24*60*60 = 17280000 Therefore, the failure rate of Trade-Up will decrease to 52.74%, meaning you will have a 47.26% chance of successfully trading up if your collective experience of your ingredient NFTs are like above. Note that, due to the nature of the blockchain development language, the displayed result may vary very slightly around the exact computed value. If you are in the failure rate, your NFT 1 with 1000000 EXP (the lowest EXP) will be burned and you will only receive the rest of your ingredient NFTs (NFT2, NFT3 and NFT4).

After 24h, the EXPs for Armoury NFTs are as follow: * Weapon EXP: 86400 * Shield EXP: 86400 * Armor EXP: 86400 * Helmet EXP: 86400 So EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400(86400 + 86400 + 86400 + 86400) / 4 = 86400(86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400 After 24h, you withdraw your Knight NFT to reassemble with Armoury NFTs you buy on Trava NFT Marketplace. Suppose, those Armoury NFTs you bought have been already farmed in vault before and have the EXPs as follow: * Weapon EXP: 86400 * Shield EXP: 100000 * Armor EXP: 320000 * Helmet EXP: 210000 Thus, the EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100(86400 + 100000 + 320000 + 210000) / 4 = 179100(86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100 There will be a lot of benefits for NFT owners to have high EXPs. The more EXP you have, the more value the NFT will be. This can help you to distinguish NFT value from other NFTs of the same type and rarity. Moreover, the EXP will be applied in our Trade-up Mechanism which will be launched soon. In the future, EXP will be used with Credit Score and applied to NFT-collateralization. It can be said that EXP is an important factor in Trava Knight NFT to reach our goal of collateralization.

What are the features of Trava Finance?,0.8855,True,"['There are six salient features of TRAVA.FINANCE, including: Crypto lending marketplace: TRAVA.FINANCE creates a marketplace in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and obtain greater earnings. Semantic knowledge graph: TRAVA.FINANCE is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA.FINANCE to efficiently search for useful information such as (i) the amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses; (ii) the provenance of an NFT; (iii) aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc. Data analysis: To reduce lending risks, TRAVA.FINANCE performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA.FINANCE recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, Loan to Value ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA.FINANCE also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools. Credit score evaluation: Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can (i) reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool; and (ii) stimulate borrowing by defining a high Loan to Value ratio for borrowers with high credit scores. Cross-chain identification and cross-chain lending: TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross- chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores. NFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals: To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA.FINANCE allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn considerable amounts from the contract.

In this event, Mr. Minh Nguyen — CEO & Co-Founder, and Mr. Thang Nguyen — CTO & Co-founder of Trava Finance — revealed Trava’s growth in the first half of 2024 and envisioned the future. Especially, unlike other AMA sessions, this one surprised the audience by starting with the community-engaging questions! 1️⃣ Answer Community questions.2️⃣ Discuss the present product of Trava.3️⃣ Information about upcoming activities and product releases. Let’s dive into the discussions in this AMA event! Answer Community Questions Right at the beginning of the AMA, the two speakers answered the community’s questions on Twitter and during the event on Telegram. Telegram Questions: : The report highlights that 64.2% of Trava Finance users are returning users accessing the DApp directly. What initiatives are in place to convert new users and expand the user base, particularly through improved marketing strategies on social channels? Mr. Thang Nguyen: Yes, you are right. This is a very important traction on Trava Finance Ecosystem meaning loyal Users trust our application. As you may know, we recently partnered with Centic to explore the potential of our Users and Ecosystem. Centic supports us in having a good view of the market, and competitors and supports us in targeting new Users and Partners. Besides, by the statistics of Centic, we have a good view of marketing activities to attract new users. Each tweet, quest campaign, and announcement will have a performance evaluation to support us have a better plan to go out with our Users. Let’s come and have a good look at the Growth of Trava Ecosystem: : With the growing adoption of TravaGPT within the platform, what are the potential risks and challenges that may arise from increasing reliance on AI-driven automation for on-chain actions? How does Trava Finance intend to proactively address these challenges to ensure a secure, trustworthy, and seamless user experience? Mr. Minh Nguyen: Surely, TravaGPT will become one of two ways for users to interact with our app in the future. The other way is Trava Station with Account Abstraction. Hence, TravaGPT will become frequently used within the platform. We also try to extend the support of TravaGPT on other chat platforms like Telegram to help users reduce the users effort when using lending pools (Trava lending pool, and others). Related to the risk, I would say there are no risks because all application logic is on the contracts. GPT is the only gateway (aka a smart interface) to call the app logic. Risk management is associated with a Data analytics function (AI-driven) to make the whole system smatter and smatter. The intelligence will eliminate risks and bring profits to users. Twitter Questions: : The introduction of Trava Station in September 2023 aimed to centralize navigation through the Trava Ecosystem. How has this feature impacted user engagement and interaction with the various products and services offered by Trava Finance, and what metrics highlight its success? Mr. Minh Nguyen: Firstly, let’s talk about the impact of Trava Station on user engagement and interaction. Station serves as a connecting center, providing short ways for users to create transactions on Trava products such as lending pools, staking vaults, governance vault, etc. Therefore, users no longer need to waste time doing multiple steps in a pool/ vault, instead, just do everything quickly at Trava Station. As I typed above, the Station is one of two ways to interact with Trava Dapp in the future (and TravaGPT is the second way). Moreover, Trava Station also provides many useful services to elevate users experience: * Trava Freight: Allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands. * Trava Junction: Allow users to pre-set transactions to be auto-executed when the conditions are met. * Portfolio: A real-time report that keeps track of all your activities and assets in Trava Station. * For the Portfolio, we will cooperate with Centic.io to exploit on-chain data and even off-chain data. * Analytics and Recommendations: Get real-time analysis and personal suggestions based on your assets and preferences to help your decision-making. With these features, Trava Station makes it easy and efficient for users to interact with Trava’s products, driving deeper engagement with Trava Finance. With the first interaction way (I mean Trava Station), the users do not need to know much about the complex of Blockchain, lending, and dex…. but they still can do a lot of things with our Station. They still have much more control and power to cook their Defi recipes if they want or let them automatically based on AI. Secondly, regarding the success of Trava Station, our recent performance report showed that most of the transactions created on Trava Finance come from the Station. This highlights the strong support and positive reception from our users for this product. : What will the future of Trava Finance’s AI Chatbot — Trava GPT be like? Will there be any new features or updates? Mr. Minh Nguyen: This year we focus mainly on AI, hence, we are trying to bring more features based on AI. And at present, for the AI Chatbot — we have TRAVAGPT. With the product, we are implementing a Telegram bot that enables users to chat on Telegram but can interact with the lending pool of Trava. I think this is a unique feature. There are no chatbot solutions can do that right now. Besides, we are also integrating gathering blockchain news feature to the Telegram chat bot. It means, if you add the bot to your Telegram, we can get the summarized news on blockchain market in the form of short new on your chat everyday. With the news, we also provide some analyses and point out the investment opportunities. You can thus make the Defi actions (borrow, lend, repay, swap, …) on Telegram Windows chat directly. Imagine, you can through chat windows do everything with Defi. This is our vision, plan, and roadmap for the year of AI 2024! Please try our TravaGPT: https://app.trava.finance/gpt : Trava Finance’s Bug Bounty program offers valuable rewards for identifying issues related to UI, logical flow, and security. How does this initiative align with Trava’s commitment to platform improvement, and what steps are being taken to ensure that feedback from this program is effectively incorporated into future updates? Mr. Thang Nguyen: Yeah, that’s a great question. As you know, Trava has a huge ecosystem with a wide range of applications. We have a lending marketplace, Trava GPT, NFT, Station, and analytics, …. All of them are complex and have a high level of technical. It took a long time for each development step and ensure the quality of products. And yeah, after the initial development, this Bug Bounty is a way for us to commit to sustainable development, and decentralization, and ensure the quality of products. As the Trava team keeps updating the products with new features and cutting-edge technologies, thorough testing and inspection are crucial to ensure true quality and bring the best experience to our Users. There’s no better way to achieve this than wide-scale public testing; thus, we hold a Bug Bounty Program, inviting everyone to help identify any problems with Trava products. In this way, the decentralization is enhanced, allowing users to contribute to product development. In the future, as Minh shares our vision, a lot of features will be released to complete our ecosystem, and the bug bounty will be one of the important parts of the development plan. To ensure the quality of the feedback in this program, we provide detailed information with clear RULES, NOTES & DISCLAIMER. 👉 Please check them HERE and follow them exactly. Discuss the Present Product of Trava First Question: Currently, Trava has updated and introduced many new features. To make it easier for users to navigate through our products, could you give us a short overview of Trava Finance, please Mr. Minh? Mr. Minh Nguyen: Let’s define Trava again: Trava Finance is an AI-driven Lending Station. The meaning of Station is “a gateway for users to connect and use any lending pools” . Starting with the lending and staking section, now we’ve developed it with many utilities. Currently, Trava Finance has 5 main products: 1️⃣ Trava Lending Market : A marketplace protocol for cross-chain lending. Our lending system combines the Trava lending pool and user-owned pools, offering users opportunities to deposit, borrow assets, or create and manage their pools. 2️⃣ Trava Staking : A staking protocol to deposit $TRAVA, $rTRAVA or $BNB to earn interest. 3️⃣ Trava Governance: A system of DAO (decentralized automated organization). It empowers users to govern Trava Finance by providing them with decision-making power. 4️⃣ Trava Station : A hub that brings together the short ways to use all Trava products, helping users to have a seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. 5️⃣ TravaGPT : An AI chatbot letting users ask for Web3 information and perform various DeFi actions in simple daily conversations. We’ll continue to update Trava with the latest trending technology, so stay tuned with us for upcoming developments! Second Question: Trava has just launched a Bug Bounty Program, which may seem a little bit mechanical and require IT knowledge.', 'TRAVA.FINANCE: Connect with TRAVA.FINANCE: Trava Finance is a cross-chain lending marketplace which offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.

Idea As announced recently, we are preparing to launch the Trava Station. Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. 2. Information Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, Freight is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes Smart Wallet , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the main interface of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don’t have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA. With Trava Freight, all those laborious, time-consuming and costly steps can be combined into a single transaction. In the current version, the scope of implementation with Freight in particular and Trava Station in general is still quite limited, mainly focusing on Lending Pool, Marketplaces, users' wallets… The actions include borrowing, returning assets, adding liquidity or withdrawing, executing conversion orders, buying or selling NFTs, tokens or other digital assets. Of course, we will develop the platform further, add more activities and features in the future, so that everyone has a truly seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. Portfolio is where you can keep track of your position and all your assets in Smart Wallet in Trava Station. Tramlines and Junction are complementary features to Freight, in which Tramlines provide a list of pre-made sequences with arranged actions for you to import. Meanwhile, Junction consists of sequences that are not executed when you create, but are made active by a system bot only when a condition is reached. * For example, you can create a set of actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price reaches $1000 — so when this threshold appears, our system bot will execute the pre-arranged actions. 3. Ask After reading the above information, you may have understood a little more about Trava Station and our vision, right? We treasure all your opinions, because you are who Trava Station was built to serve. So let us know what you think about this upcoming product, suggesting for further development!! And look forward to the launch of Trava Station on August 24, 2023 . Trava Administration 11 Aug 2023, 21:06 * Idea Contest Discussion posted in Governance Idea: So, the Idea Contest has ended, and we are very happy to have received the enthusiastic participation of many members. There are those who gave not only one but dozens of different opinions, on many aspects and products of Trava Finance. From there, we have selected 10 ideas to proceed further: 1. Open a contest for community members to create their own knights. 2. Restructure the main page of Trava, removing the mountains with links to make it seem more user-friendly and easier to understand Trava's focus. 3. Expand to other chains and add new ones, since BNB is in a potentially risky position. 4. Add more DeFi protocols to BRicher, regularly updating good protocols and removing unsafe ones. 5. Simplify the parameters in Lending Pools and add more tokens. Add a type of notification so people would know when liquidations are close. 6. Increase the utility of TRAVA tokens by adding continuous token burn feature, periodically burning minted TRAVA. Allow them to be exchanged on all chains in Trava Lending. 7. Reopen BNB/Trava safety passbook. 8. Launch Knights leasing feature. 9. Do Idea Contest more periodically. 10. Start marketing on Crew3. Motivation: Each of the ideas has been thoroughly researched by us, evaluated for their potential and feasibility. Don't be sad if your ideas are not here, they might just be slightly deviating from Trava Finance's development orientation, or not yet capable of being put into practice. This discussion is open in order to be able to involve the whole community in contributing to the development of Trava Finance. It’s expected to be a stepping stone before starting the voting snapshot, for everyone to dive deeper into these ideas and voice their own comments. From there, it is also possible for you to pick the best choices for the development of Trava, choosing a worthy winner (or winners). The founders and POs of Trava Finance will also check out this discussion, so don't be afraid to dig into each issue and ask the hard questions.

']","['Register **Registration Error** × Looks like your connection to Trava Forum was lost, please wait while we try to reconnect.', ""Figure 3: An example of the cross-chain knowledge graph The knowledge graph is one of the most fundamental components of TRAVA.FINANCE, which is responsible for storing and representing aggregated data from multiple blockchain networks. The graph and TRAVA.FINANCE protocols make independent blockchains interconnected and create the internet of hyper-linked blockchains, allowing DApps to address complex business in reality. Figure 3 shows an example of the knowledge graph. The circle represents an entity (or instance) of data such as a wallet address, a user, a lending pool, an NFT, or other types of digital assets. Each entity is associated with other entities in certain relationships, represented by directional arrows; the direction of an arrow is the direction of the relationship. The white rectangles are the values for the data attributes of the entity. The example graph shows that the WalletAddress2 is on the Ethereum network and that address owns an NFT. Aggregated information of the NFT, such as the highest bid price, number of auctions, list of addresses ever owned, etc., are also represented in the knowledge graph. Let us assume that a user creates one address on the Bitcoin network and one address on the Ethereum network. Because there were no relationships among these addresses, the knowledge graph creates two anonymous users, i.e., AnonymousUser1 and AnonymousUser2. AnonymousUser1 owns the Bitcoin addresses (i.e., WalletAddress3), and AnonymousUser2 has one Ethereum address, i.e., WalletAddress1. Various information related to a wallet address is stored in the graph. For example, the WalletAddress3 entity contains the _average balance_ , the _total amount of ETHs transferred in and out_ , the _total number of transactions_ , or _the average, median, mode,_ and _highest number of ETHs transferred in one transaction._ Assuming the user wants to increase his/her credit score or use up all of his/her cryptos as collateral for a loan, he or she can unify all addresses as one via the cross-chain identification protocol performed in only one TRAVA.FINANCE's transaction. After completing the transaction, the two anonymous users are linked by the _sameAs_ relationship. Depending on users’ needs, the cross-chain identification protocol also supports linking two wallet address entities by a _guarantee_ relationship. Once an address is lost, if all the addresses that guarantee the address confirm the loss, the address status will be claimed as _lost_ in the knowledge graph. Wallet addresses can also be connected by a _transfer_ relationship. To ensure scalability, rather than detailed transactions, statistical and aggregated information on transactions is calculated and stored in that _transfer_ relationship. As in the knowledge graph example above, several remarkable pieces of information are saved, including _BlockchainAddress1 has transferred 400 ETHs in total to BlockchainAddress2; it is performed through 10 transactions, and the largest transaction transfers 200 ETHs._ To avoid junk addresses and junk digital assets, we do not store all blockchain entities in the knowledge graph. The number of transactions or the maximum of cryptos transferred in one transaction related to an NFT or an address needs to surpass a threshold so that the NFT and the address will be added to the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph can also represent other types of entities, relationships, and properties. We develop a unified interface so that the expansion of the knowledge graph can be done in a logical, consistent, effective, scalable, and standardized manner. As the knowledge graph plays a crucial role, it can only be updated by a TRAVA.FINANCE’s validator, and this must be agreed upon by other validators on the network. The knowledge graph needs to be infinitely extended while the assigned number of TRAVA.FINANCEs is fixed and finite. Thus it is not possible to pay fees for updating the graph. However, there should also be a way to encourage validators to update and enrich the knowledge graph. To reconcile this contradiction, TRAVA.FINANCE requires and also encourages validators to update the knowledge graph. On the one hand, validators must update the knowledge graph regularly, otherwise, they will be stripped of their validator role, and cannot earn rewards for appending new blocks or verifying transactions. On the other hand, each time enriching the knowledge graph, validators will gain the fame score, thereby gaining more priorities and indirectly having the opportunity to earn more TRAVA.FINANCE coins when joining the network. Priorities may include voting power or the privilege to unlock TRAVA.FINANCE tokens earlier than the standard time when receiving awards. Enriching the graph is a special kind of TRAVA.FINANCE transaction that requires no fee. Out of all transactions, graph-related transactions are extracted and stored separately in files along with their hash value. This allows validators and other nodes to (re)construct the graph more efficiently with their own graph database systems. PreviousArchitectureNextCross-chain Identification Last updated 3 years ago Was this helpful?"", 'Figure 1: Main features of TRAVA.FINANCE TRAVA.FINANCE (or TRAVA) is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrowing/lending interest rate, liquidity threshold, Loan to Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA.FINANCE offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA.FINANCE is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks. The pool owners, who are an additional role to lenders and borrowers, can receive more earnings by devising a good lending strategy for their pools. Moreover, to reduce risks and stimulate lending and borrowing, TRAVA.FINANCE performs cross-chain data analysis on multiple blockchain networks to (i) recommend optimal pool parameters for pool owners and (ii) detect unusual transactions in their pools. The lending marketplace model of TRAVA.FINANCE will increase crypto liquidity and promote the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. There are six salient features of TRAVA.FINANCE, including: * **Crypto lending marketplace** : TRAVA.FINANCE creates a **marketplace** in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and obtain greater earnings. * **Semantic knowledge graph** : TRAVA.FINANCE is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA.FINANCE to efficiently search for useful information such as (i) the amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses; (ii) the provenance of an NFT; (iii) aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc. * **Data analysis** : To reduce lending risks, TRAVA.FINANCE performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA.FINANCE recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, Loan to Value ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA.FINANCE also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools. * **Credit score evaluation** : Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can (i) reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool; and (ii) stimulate borrowing by defining a high Loan to Value ratio for borrowers with high credit scores. * **Cross-chain identification and cross-chain lending** : TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross- chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores. * **NFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals** : To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA.FINANCE allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn considerable amounts from the contract.

The former uses the protocols and the cross-chain knowledge graph provided by the latter so that end-users can interact with TRAVA.FINANCE marketplace and perform their lending functionalities. _TRAVA.FINANCE marketplace_ offers three lending roles for end-users. In other approaches, end-users can only participate in the lending business as either borrowers or lenders. In the TRAVA.FINANCE _marketplace_ , pool owners may play the additional role for them to start their own lending business and obtain greater earnings. To this end, they create and maintain their own lending pool. TRAVA.FINANCE performs blockchain data analysis to help them adapt optimal pool parameters to their lending strategy. In order for lenders, borrowers, and pool owners to perform lending business operations, TRAVA.FINANCE develops smart contracts divided into 5 groups: (1) Pool parameter optimization, (2) Cross-chain digital asset evaluation, (3) Credit score evaluation, (4) Digital asset (NFT, stoke token, etc.) auction-based pricing, and (5) Data analysis. These smart contracts are deployed on all nodes in the TRAVA.FINANCE network. To enable cross-chain lending, _TRAVA.FINANCE_ marketplace also includes “Cross-chain Digital Asset Management” smart contracts, which interact with users’ digital assets on multiple blockchain networks. The smart contracts allow TRAVA.FINANCE to query users’ balance, aggregate their cryptos, or lock their certain amount of cryptos. These cross-chain interactions require a network of validators to participate in to collect, confirm, and verify cross-chain data. TRAVA.FINANCE marketplace makes use of TRAVA.FINANCE foundation to communicate with other blockchain networks and implement the lending functionalities offered to end-users. TRAVA.FINANCE foundation is built on the hyper-linked datachain protocol. It uses three ToVChain's protocols, including (1) Data exchange protocol to enable interactions between TRAVA.FINANCE and other blockchain networks, (2) Data linking protocol to enrich the cross- chain knowledge graph with linked financial data collected from multiple chains, and (3) Cross- chain identification protocol to identify the same owner of multiple wallet addresses on single or multiple blockchain networks and thus facilitate fast and efficient mortgage placement. TRAVA.FINANCE foundation also uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to perform data analysis and evaluate users’ credit scores. The knowledge graph is presented in the next section.

It can be used to verify that multiple addresses on different chains belong to the same user. The protocol allows TRAVA.FINANCE to provide an overview of anonymous users, including their total cryptos and other digital assets, statistics for their transactions, and their relationships with other blockchain addresses. These types of information and relationships are stored on the cross-chain knowledge graph. The protocol can (i) improve the credit score of the users and their wallet address so that they can get favorable interest rates, (ii) save them transaction fees since they can use up all of their cryptos as collateral in a single transaction, and (iii) allow them to get their cryptos back when they lose one of their wallet address. To implement the protocol, we develop a wallet application so that users can manage their accounts and prove their ownership of multiple accounts. The application provides users with two functionalities: “Add account” and “Create a proof of ownership”. Users can add a new account to the wallet application in multiple ways, e.g., (i) create an account, (ii) import a private key, and (iii) connect to a hardware wallet. To foster their DeFi transactions, they might need to prove that they are the owner of n addresses. To this end, they can use our wallet application to perform a transaction that activates the cross-chain identification protocol. Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators check the accuracy of the data associated with the transaction. If the data is valid, the validators accept the transaction and write the sameAs relationship among the owners of the addresses to the knowledge graph. In the following we describe our processing to verify the cross-chain identification of multiple wallet addresses. User side: Assume that a user would like to confirm her ownership for 3 accounts, the wallet creates a message containing 3 data elements, each includes a pair of a chainId and a public key . Every element has a fixed size of 41 bytes: 8 bytes for the chainId and 33 bytes for the public key . The data format is as follows: * data1 (41 bytes) := chainId1 (8 bytes) + pub1 (33 bytes) * data2 (41 bytes) := chainId2 (8 bytes) + pub2 (33 bytes) * data3 (41 bytes) := chainId3 (8 bytes) + pub3 (33 bytes) The wallet uses the Merkle tree to hash the data and obtains the rootHash (32 bytes) * rootHash := MerkleTree([data1,data2,data3]).getRoot() The user then uses her 3 private keys to sign on the rootHash . Each signing creates a signature, named si (64 bytes): * s1 := Sign(rootHash, prv1) * s2 := Sign(rootHash, prv2) * s3 := Sign(rootHash, prv3) Finally, a transaction is generated and broadcasted to validators. A sample of transaction payload is as follows: * Type (8 bytes): ""SameAs"" * Number (4 bytes): 3 // The number of addresses * Message (n 41 bytes): data1 data2 data3 * Signatures (n 64 bytes): s1 s2 s3 * Timestamp (8 bytes): 1619602364 The total size of a transaction to prove n accounts of the same user is: 20 + n * 105 bytes Validator side: Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators verify the timestamp and then verify the signatures as follows. They first extract the message {data1, … datan} and the list of signatures {s1, … sn} . From each data element datai , the validators get the chainId and the public key (i.e., pubi ). They use the Merkle tree to hash the data and regenerate the rootHash : * rootHash := MerkleTree([data1, data2, data3]).getRoot() The validators then use pubi to verify signature si on the rootHash: * verifySignature(rootHash, s1 , pub1) => valid/invalid * verifySignature(rootHash, s2 , pub1) => valid/invalid * verifySignature(rootHash, s3 , pub1) => valid/invalid Once all signatures are valid, the validators agree that all accounts stored in the message belong to the same user. From n pairs of chainId and public key , the validators calculate the respective addresses of the user. To eliminate useless addresses, the validators perform additional checks on the age of the address, its average balance, or the total number of transactions related to the address.

The graph and TRAVA.FINANCE protocols make independent blockchains interconnected and create the internet of hyper-linked blockchains, allowing DApps to address complex business in reality. Figure 3 shows an example of the knowledge graph. The circle represents an entity (or instance) of data such as a wallet address, a user, a lending pool, an NFT, or other types of digital assets. Each entity is associated with other entities in certain relationships, represented by directional arrows; the direction of an arrow is the direction of the relationship. The white rectangles are the values for the data attributes of the entity. The example graph shows that the WalletAddress2 is on the Ethereum network and that address owns an NFT. Aggregated information of the NFT, such as the highest bid price, number of auctions, list of addresses ever owned, etc., are also represented in the knowledge graph. Let us assume that a user creates one address on the Bitcoin network and one address on the Ethereum network. Because there were no relationships among these addresses, the knowledge graph creates two anonymous users, i.e., AnonymousUser1 and AnonymousUser2. AnonymousUser1 owns the Bitcoin addresses (i.e., WalletAddress3), and AnonymousUser2 has one Ethereum address, i.e., WalletAddress1. Various information related to a wallet address is stored in the graph. For example, the WalletAddress3 entity contains the _average balance_ , the _total amount of ETHs transferred in and out_ , the _total number of transactions_ , or _the average, median, mode,_ and _highest number of ETHs transferred in one transaction._ Assuming the user wants to increase his/her credit score or use up all of his/her cryptos as collateral for a loan, he or she can unify all addresses as one via the cross-chain identification protocol performed in only one TRAVA.FINANCE's transaction. After completing the transaction, the two anonymous users are linked by the _sameAs_ relationship. Depending on users’ needs, the cross-chain identification protocol also supports linking two wallet address entities by a _guarantee_ relationship. Once an address is lost, if all the addresses that guarantee the address confirm the loss, the address status will be claimed as _lost_ in the knowledge graph. Wallet addresses can also be connected by a _transfer_ relationship. To ensure scalability, rather than detailed transactions, statistical and aggregated information on transactions is calculated and stored in that _transfer_ relationship. As in the knowledge graph example above, several remarkable pieces of information are saved, including _BlockchainAddress1 has transferred 400 ETHs in total to BlockchainAddress2; it is performed through 10 transactions, and the largest transaction transfers 200 ETHs._ To avoid junk addresses and junk digital assets, we do not store all blockchain entities in the knowledge graph. The number of transactions or the maximum of cryptos transferred in one transaction related to an NFT or an address needs to surpass a threshold so that the NFT and the address will be added to the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph can also represent other types of entities, relationships, and properties. We develop a unified interface so that the expansion of the knowledge graph can be done in a logical, consistent, effective, scalable, and standardized manner. As the knowledge graph plays a crucial role, it can only be updated by a TRAVA.FINANCE’s validator, and this must be agreed upon by other validators on the network. The knowledge graph needs to be infinitely extended while the assigned number of TRAVA.FINANCEs is fixed and finite. Thus it is not possible to pay fees for updating the graph. However, there should also be a way to encourage validators to update and enrich the knowledge graph. To reconcile this contradiction, TRAVA.FINANCE requires and also encourages validators to update the knowledge graph. On the one hand, validators must update the knowledge graph regularly, otherwise, they will be stripped of their validator role, and cannot earn rewards for appending new blocks or verifying transactions. On the other hand, each time enriching the knowledge graph, validators will gain the fame score, thereby gaining more priorities and indirectly having the opportunity to earn more TRAVA.FINANCE coins when joining the network. Priorities may include voting power or the privilege to unlock TRAVA.FINANCE tokens earlier than the standard time when receiving awards. Enriching the graph is a special kind of TRAVA.FINANCE transaction that requires no fee. Out of all transactions, graph-related transactions are extracted and stored separately in files along with their hash value. This allows validators and other nodes to (re)construct the graph more efficiently with their own graph database systems. PreviousArchitectureNextCross-chain Identification Last updated 3 years ago Was this helpful?"", 'Where can I see my credit score? : Go to https://scoring.trava.finance/credit-score/orai and connect your wallet, you will see your credit score right on the screen. What is users’ credit score? : In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. What benefits does credit score brings to users? : -For borrowers, the primary benefit is that they can borrow with a ""preferential interest rate"" if their credit score is high. They can also receive higher loan-to-value-ratio compared to other users For lenders, who have high credit scores easily become LPs of different pools. Moreover, when they create a pool, their pool will have a higher credit score because the pool creator\'s credit score is also a criterion for the pool scoring. Especially, pool owners can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. How Credit scores for wallet addresses are calculated? : To evaluate credit scores for wallet addresses, TRAVA credit scoring model will take into account 5 factors: 1. Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address. 2. Transaction history: TRAVA aggregates all transactions of a wallet address across all platforms to calculate various parameters such as (i) transaction amount, (ii) number of liquidations, etc. 3. Loans ratio: represents the debt position of an account, including the Loan-to-balance ratio and Loan-to-investment ratio. 4. Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. 5. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range. The z-score is calculated from the mean and the standard deviation from every corresponding parameter of all accounts. To be more specific, you can read this function in TRAVA whitepaper. How the user\'s credit score will be updated? : Our system has both periodic updates and instant updates. The instant update occurs when users actively make transactions such as deposit, withdraw, repay... Or when users view their credit score on our app. In case a user has not viewed their credit score and had no transactions for a long time, their credit score is still updated periodically and automatically, which can be weekly or monthly. We are still trying to optimize it. Which objects does Trava evaluate credit score for? : At the moment, Trava has been evaluating the credit scores for 3 types of Objects: Wallet addresses (users), tokens, and NFTs. How to increase my credit score? : To improve the credit score of your wallet, you would need to take into account our five parameters, i.e., Total asset, Transaction history, Loans ratios, Circulating assets, and Trustworthiness of possessing assets. For instance, you should increase your wallet balance with prestige coins and tokens, perform more transactions and become more active in the crypto market, maintaining good Loan-to-balance and Loan-to-investment ratios, supply more liquidity to lending pools, trade on lending DApps to earn as much profit as you can, avoid collateral liquidation while borrowing, and possess at least $1000 valuable token (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, or BNB). Besides, you need to be credible users for a long time. It is because to avoid fraud, TRAVA calculates some credit score parameters based on their average values in the last k days, where k depends on the volatility of the crypto market. Moreover, some parameters are assessed based on the “standardized score” function, which calculates the mean and the standard deviation of all accounts’ parameters. Thus, trying to be the best at some criteria would improve your credit score too. Why did my credit score decrease? : The reasons why your credit score drops might be: You have bad transactions such as borrowing liquidations, your balance decrease, your borrowing rate is higher, you are not active enough, etc...You can read our white paper to understand how the credit score mechanism functions. https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/credit-score-evaluation PreviousTroubleshootingNextNFTs Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?', 'Connect your wallet and select a network: : Connect wallet: Step 1.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

How can users gain governance power in Trava DAO?,0.8787,True,"['To gain governance power, holders need to lock their Trava or rTrava token in exchange for the veTRAVA token, which holds voting power. This vote locking mechanism encourages users who show a solid commitment to the protocol with more governance power and incentive. ']","['Trava Governance module aims to bring the protocol to a new level of decentralization - Trava DAO. This module presents an on-chain governance mechanism, where the Trava community can propose and vote on protocol changes & improvements as a way of participating in the protocol’s decision-making process. In the big picture, there are four essential components in Trava Governance: the Trava community, the DAO Committee, the Security Advisory Board (SAB), and Governance Portal & smart contracts. * Trava community: The most valuable resource of ideas, discussions & feedback for protocol changes. Everyone can raise their voice & share their opinion on Trava Forum or any community social channels. * DAO Committee: The entrusted individuals in the Trava community to submit proposals after a thorough review with discussion & feedback. * Security Advisory Board: The guardian for the protocol’s security when some malicious actions are aimed at the protocol or in unexpected events. * Governance Portal & Smart contracts: The autonomous “Hand of the King” consists of governance contracts for on-chain voting and multiple timelocks governing and automating the changes & updates of Trava Ecosystem’s smart contracts. That keeps the governance process public and transparent to everyone. NextDAO Last updated 1 year ago', ""%: % Total locked Percentage of total TRAVA and rTRAVA locked. % veTRAVA APR When participating in the Trava Governance, users get rewards in TRAVA tokens. The APR, in this case, shows how these rewards would be during the 1-year period. % Voted-locked Percentage of total TRAVA and rTRAVA locked including voting escrow only. % Warm-up APR Besides weekly rewards, users who lock TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB in the Trava Governance vault can receive warm-up rewards in the first week. In this case, the APR is for calculating the warm-up rewards. A: Active status A signal of the voting period. Anyone can vote For or Against once for each proposal. Avg. lock time The average period of locking TRAVA, rTRAVA, LP TRAVA/BNB in the Trava Governance Vault. Cancel status A signal of a proposal that has been canceled by the SAB or the proposer themselves for some reason. C: Compound reward The activity of compounding the weekly rewards in the Trava Governance Vault to increase voting power. Compoundable rewards Besides voting power, users who lock TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB in the Trava Governance Vault can receive weekly rewards. These rewards can be compounded and locked back in the Trava Governance Vault to increase the voting power. D: DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) An organization constructed by rules encoded as a computer program that is often transparent, controlled by the organization's members, and not influenced by a central government.

M: Merge veTRAVA A function that allows users to merge two veTRAVANFTs together while preserving voting power and reward. Since each address can create a maximum of 50 veTrava, this function helps users to clear pocket space and reduce gas fees when casting their vote. O: Off-chain Voting Off-chain voting refers to governance systems where individual votes are not submitted as blockchain transactions. No transaction fees are necessary for off-chain votes. On-chain Voting On-chain voting refers to governance systems where individual votes are submitted as transactions and recorded directly on the blockchain.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

What is veTRAVA?,0.9034,True,"['veTRAVA stands for voting escrow Trava. It is an ERC721 token that acts as evidence of your locking token in the governance module. Every time users create a new lock, they receive a veTRAVA token, storing their locked balance, unlock time, and rewards amount. The longer you lock your tokens, the more voting power you have (and the bigger incentive you can earn). For example, you can vote lock 1,000 TRAVA/rTRAVA for a year to have 250 voting power. Each token locked for four years is equal to 1 voting power. The number of voting power you will receive depends on your locked balance & unlock time.  The minimum locking time is one week, and the maximum locking time is four years. Your voting power gradually decreases as your escrow tokens approach their lock expiry. The graph on Locker UI from Governance Portal illustrates the decrease process.

Creating a user-friendly landing page is one of the priorities for better user experience. Additionally, Trava Finance lending product team should start working on adding more tokens to ""Token Health"" so they could be added to pool creation once the product is 100% finished - having more tokens available for pool creation feature is an advantage to attract more userbase and investors. Lastly, I like the (idea 4.) - creating more DeFi investment options to explore in DeFi Cryptospace is great for expanding community knowledge about investment possibilities and also making the BRicher tool more flexible.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process.

We will recalculate and update the price based on the price on the market, the initial price and the data analysis extracted from our NFT Marketplace. Note that with each wallet, the maximum number of Trava Knight NFT that can be deposited in one vault is one Knight NFT. For example, if you have two Trava Knight NFTs of Gold, for example, you can only stake one of them into Gold Vault to farm and earn $TRAVA rewards. With Copper, Silver and Gold Vault, if NFT owners withdraw their NFTs within 7 days, the farming rewards will decrease by 10%. Knights with a higher rarity can be deposited in vaults of a lower rarity. Continuing the example above, one of your Gold Knights can be deposited in Gold vault and the other can be deposited in either Copper vault or Silver vault and earn APR corresponding to those vaults. Furthermore, for Knight NFTs put in Farming vaults, we shall use the ""Polish Mechanism”. After depositing Knight NFTs in those vaults, users must check their Knights on a regular basis through the Farming site, which is considered a polishing action. If users never check their Knights, the Glossiness of their Knights will deteriorate, and the Farming rewards will drop. So, to maintain the rewards from Knight NFTs, NFT owners must perform ""polishing"" action, which means check their NFTs in the vaults regularly. : Formula to calculate Farming rewards How to calculate the rewards for Copper, Silver and Gold Vaults? Each vault has a value called emissionPerSecond . This is a fixed amount that all depositors will be rewarded when they deposit NFT per second. Therefore, the fewer number of people staking NFT, the more rewards each staker will get. How to calculate the rewards for Diamond and Crystal Vaults? The Glossiness of each NFT starts off at 100%, but it gradually decreases over time, affecting the incentives received when users deposit their NFTs in the vault. Users must complete ""Polishing"" acts in order to receive 100% of the rewards. The amount of reward from NFT polishing shall be calculated using 2 parameters: decayRate and decayInterval . Concretely, after a decayInterval (a certain amount of time), if the NFT is not polished, the rewards for the next decayInterval will be reduced ( decayRate , calculated in % will decrease) For example: decayInterval = 2 days and decayRate = 10% indicates that: every two days without polishing, the rewards of the next day will be reduced (due to the NFT glossiness). Hence, after 20 days, the amount of rewards for NFT will be 0. If you stake NFT for a period t = 9, the amount of incentives that you probably get is 450 Trava (On average per day you will get 450/9 = 50). However, you have forgotten to polish for 9 days. Then, the amount of rewards you receive is only 370 Trava. The amount of incentive you get is described as below: Minus Rewards 10% 10% 20% 20% 30% 30% 40% Remaining Rewards(TRAVA) The detailed calculation us as follows: (X is the rewards NFT depositor will receive after t days) The average rewards each day NFT staker will receive: m=m = \\frac{X}{t} Number of decayInterval that depositor have to go through: n=tdecayIntervaln = \\frac{t}{decayInterval}decayInterval\u200b The result of this calculation will be rounded down.']","['https://docs.trava.finance/user-guide/trava-dao-user-guide', 'https://docs.trava.finance/glossary/trava-governance-glossary', 'https://docs.trava.finance/user-guide/trava-pottery-user-guide', 'https://docs.trava.finance/pottery-mechanism/rewards-mechanism', 'https://docs.trava.finance/nfts/trava-nft-farming']",['https://docs.trava.finance/governance/incentive']

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

Creating a user-friendly landing page is one of the priorities for better user experience. Additionally, Trava Finance lending product team should start working on adding more tokens to ""Token Health"" so they could be added to pool creation once the product is 100% finished - having more tokens available for pool creation feature is an advantage to attract more userbase and investors. Lastly, I like the (idea 4.) - creating more DeFi investment options to explore in DeFi Cryptospace is great for expanding community knowledge about investment possibilities and also making the BRicher tool more flexible. Having more protocols/chains/networks to choose from can expand the use-case of the tool. * IdeaContest Decentralised crypto payment system fulkano: 3 May 2023, 20:02 4 May 2023, 14:03 1 Votes 2 Posts 12 Views 4 May 2023, 14:03 @fulkano Thats good idea.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

After the Trava Lottery and Battlehand, the next game — Fortune Mining, will be soon published on September 8th 2022. Introduction to fortune mining What is Fortune Mining? As mentioned, this is an important component of the Trava Minigame Series. The game is built on the well-known blockchain idea of the No-loss-rewards game, allowing participants to earn big prizes without worrying about losing their money. How does it work? So how exactly does Fortune Mining work? For more details, users first need to deposit their money into the Fortune Mining Pool. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm). That means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones. The benefit Fortune Mining brings to players. _No loss to worry about_: As the old saying goes, “More risk brings higher return.” However, with Fortune Mining, players will not need to worry about their losses. Because of the unique mechanism, there will be no loss, and unlucky players can get their deposits back after a certain period. _Big prize to look for_: While there is no loss to be concerned about, the winner may earn significantly more benefits than they would if they had deposited into the regular pool. For example , assuming that we run a Fortune Mining pool for users to deposit DAI and gain 20.000 DAI in total deposited after one week. With APY at 1.5% (that is converted to APR at about 0,92%) and APR at 4.08%, respectively, two weeks later, the total reward for the winner will be calculated as: _20000 (0.92%+ 4.08%)/365 14 = 38.356 DAI._ That means if you deposit 100 DAI at first and become the lucky one, you will receive about $38,356 (the interest rate at about 1000%) instead of $0,19 (the interest rate at about 5%). As in the example above, the gap between the rewards you could get in a normal pool and the Fortune Mining pool is very significant. For that reason, this mini-game will be a good choice for those with small capital to try their luck and get much more money than usual. To sum up, what do you need to do to attain the benefits? Step 1. Deposit your token into the Fortune Mining Pool Step 2. Waiting for a certain period (depending on each campaign) Step 3 . Check the result: * If you are the lucky one: Congratulations, you get all the rewards from the pool * If you have not been lucky yet, don’t worry, you can withdraw your deposit or keep them in the pool, then try your luck in the next period. Notes: We will soon run a voting snapshot for our community to decide which asset should be put in the Fortune Mining pool. Stay tuned for that.

Ticket, an asset with a fixed price range, will become one of the primary collaterals in the Trava ecosystem that users can collateralize to borrow from the system. The Ticket also allows users to have access to Auction/Sell/Buy veTRAVA in the NFT Marketplace as an NFT. These two utilities confirm the crucial position of Ticket in the journey of Trava NFT-collateralized. Trava Capital: Besides Trava Knight NFT, Trava Lending, Ticket also has its own role in TraDAO as a supportive asset. As a result, investors of TraDAO will enjoy the APR increase while owning a Ticket. Play-to-earn in MiniGame Series: Tickets will act like rewards and entrances for Fortune Mining. The detailed mechanism will be released soon. Moreover, users can earn more Tickets (besides the winning bet) by joining the Battle Hand MiniGame. In the near future, more MiniGames will be launched with the integration of Ticket. Trade-to-earn: Besides the above, users can also sell Counter Tickets at Trava Counter at 80% of the current Counter price. Moreover, all Ticket types, including Counter Tickets, Presale Tickets, and Incentive Tickets, can be sold in the Ticket Marketplace at a price determined by sellers (peer-to-peer). With the potential ability of Ticket, right after release, the Ticket utilities will be implemented throughout the Trava ecosystem. In the long term, more and more Ticket features will be released to meet the demand of Trava users constantly. : Business Model _An overall of the Trava Tickets_: As you can see, there are 3 types of tickets: - Counter Ticket: tickets released by the Trava Counter - Presale Ticket: tickets released from the presale program - Incentive Ticket: rewards users receive when joining Trava programs Depending on their types, tickets could be sold/bought on Trava Counter or Trava Marketplace. In addition, as mentioned, these tickets can also be used to participate in various programs of Trava Capital, Trava Lending, Trava Knight NFT, Minigame Series, etc. You can check out more information in the article Introduction to Trava Ticket utilities. _The circular benefit_: As mentioned, trading and accessing the Trava ecosystem are the two critical utilities of Trava Ticket. By owning tickets and then applying in both of these two functions, you can optimize their benefits. Let’s take a closer look at how you can get benefits with Trava Ticket: _Benefit of Trading_: _Benefit of accessing various products and features in the Trava Ecosystem_: All tickets of all kinds can be used to access these features. Scenario 1. Applied in Trava Capital: The ticket can be used to boost APR i n Trava Capital which will then increase your profit. Scenario 2. Applied in Trava Lending: By owning tickets, you can get much more benefits in Trava Lending, relating to Trava Governance, Trava Bridge, Fortune Mining Pool, and Auction as well as collateral. More specific, using tickets, you can: - Change time/balance lock in Trava Governance - Be allowed to implement multiple transactions in Trava Bridge - Borrow assets with Tickets as NFT-collateralized - Withdraw rewards in Governance earlier - Be able to put veTRAVA on the Auction/Sell/Buy program. Scenario 3. Applied in Trava Knight NFT: Take a look at the diagram that shows how you can apply for Tickets in the Trava Knight NFT programs. To be more specific, you can first buy tickets, then use them to exchange for chests. After opening your chests and getting armories, you can either exchange them on the NFT marketplace or continue collecting armories to assemble the Trava NFT Knight. Then, you have multiple options related to trading or to joining missions and minigames.

After the Trava Lottery and Battlehand, the next game — Fortune Mining, will be soon published on September 8th 2022. Introduction to fortune mining What is Fortune Mining? As mentioned, this is an important component of the Trava Minigame Series. The game is built on the well-known blockchain idea of the No-loss-rewards game, allowing participants to earn big prizes without worrying about losing their money. How does it work? So how exactly does Fortune Mining work? For more details, users first need to deposit their money into the Fortune Mining Pool. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm). That means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones. The benefit Fortune Mining brings to players. _No loss to worry about_: As the old saying goes, “More risk brings higher return.” However, with Fortune Mining, players will not need to worry about their losses. Because of the unique mechanism, there will be no loss, and unlucky players can get their deposits back after a certain period. _Big prize to look for_: While there is no loss to be concerned about, the winner may earn significantly more benefits than they would if they had deposited into the regular pool. For example , assuming that we run a Fortune Mining pool for users to deposit DAI and gain 20.000 DAI in total deposited after one week. With APY at 1.5% (that is converted to APR at about 0,92%) and APR at 4.08%, respectively, two weeks later, the total reward for the winner will be calculated as: _20000 (0.92%+ 4.08%)/365 14 = 38.356 DAI._ That means if you deposit 100 DAI at first and become the lucky one, you will receive about $38,356 (the interest rate at about 1000%) instead of $0,19 (the interest rate at about 5%). As in the example above, the gap between the rewards you could get in a normal pool and the Fortune Mining pool is very significant. For that reason, this mini-game will be a good choice for those with small capital to try their luck and get much more money than usual. To sum up, what do you need to do to attain the benefits? Step 1. Deposit your token into the Fortune Mining Pool Step 2. Waiting for a certain period (depending on each campaign) Step 3 . Check the result: * If you are the lucky one: Congratulations, you get all the rewards from the pool * If you have not been lucky yet, don’t worry, you can withdraw your deposit or keep them in the pool, then try your luck in the next period. Notes: We will soon run a voting snapshot for our community to decide which asset should be put in the Fortune Mining pool. Stay tuned for that.

Ticket, an asset with a fixed price range, will become one of the primary collaterals in the Trava ecosystem that users can collateralize to borrow from the system. The Ticket also allows users to have access to Auction/Sell/Buy veTRAVA in the NFT Marketplace as an NFT. These two utilities confirm the crucial position of Ticket in the journey of Trava NFT-collateralized. Trava Capital: Besides Trava Knight NFT, Trava Lending, Ticket also has its own role in TraDAO as a supportive asset. As a result, investors of TraDAO will enjoy the APR increase while owning a Ticket. Play-to-earn in MiniGame Series: Tickets will act like rewards and entrances for Fortune Mining. The detailed mechanism will be released soon. Moreover, users can earn more Tickets (besides the winning bet) by joining the Battle Hand MiniGame. In the near future, more MiniGames will be launched with the integration of Ticket. Trade-to-earn: Besides the above, users can also sell Counter Tickets at Trava Counter at 80% of the current Counter price. Moreover, all Ticket types, including Counter Tickets, Presale Tickets, and Incentive Tickets, can be sold in the Ticket Marketplace at a price determined by sellers (peer-to-peer). With the potential ability of Ticket, right after release, the Ticket utilities will be implemented throughout the Trava ecosystem. In the long term, more and more Ticket features will be released to meet the demand of Trava users constantly. : Business Model _An overall of the Trava Tickets_: As you can see, there are 3 types of tickets: - Counter Ticket: tickets released by the Trava Counter - Presale Ticket: tickets released from the presale program - Incentive Ticket: rewards users receive when joining Trava programs Depending on their types, tickets could be sold/bought on Trava Counter or Trava Marketplace. In addition, as mentioned, these tickets can also be used to participate in various programs of Trava Capital, Trava Lending, Trava Knight NFT, Minigame Series, etc. You can check out more information in the article Introduction to Trava Ticket utilities. _The circular benefit_: As mentioned, trading and accessing the Trava ecosystem are the two critical utilities of Trava Ticket. By owning tickets and then applying in both of these two functions, you can optimize their benefits. Let’s take a closer look at how you can get benefits with Trava Ticket: _Benefit of Trading_: _Benefit of accessing various products and features in the Trava Ecosystem_: All tickets of all kinds can be used to access these features. Scenario 1. Applied in Trava Capital: The ticket can be used to boost APR i n Trava Capital which will then increase your profit. Scenario 2. Applied in Trava Lending: By owning tickets, you can get much more benefits in Trava Lending, relating to Trava Governance, Trava Bridge, Fortune Mining Pool, and Auction as well as collateral. More specific, using tickets, you can: - Change time/balance lock in Trava Governance - Be allowed to implement multiple transactions in Trava Bridge - Borrow assets with Tickets as NFT-collateralized - Withdraw rewards in Governance earlier - Be able to put veTRAVA on the Auction/Sell/Buy program. Scenario 3. Applied in Trava Knight NFT: Take a look at the diagram that shows how you can apply for Tickets in the Trava Knight NFT programs. To be more specific, you can first buy tickets, then use them to exchange for chests. After opening your chests and getting armories, you can either exchange them on the NFT marketplace or continue collecting armories to assemble the Trava NFT Knight. Then, you have multiple options related to trading or to joining missions and minigames.

We will recalculate and update the price based on the price on the market, the initial price and the data analysis extracted from our NFT Marketplace. Note that with each wallet, the maximum number of Trava Knight NFT that can be deposited in one vault is one Knight NFT. For example, if you have two Trava Knight NFTs of Gold, for example, you can only stake one of them into Gold Vault to farm and earn $TRAVA rewards. With Copper, Silver and Gold Vault, if NFT owners withdraw their NFTs within 7 days, the farming rewards will decrease by 10%. Knights with a higher rarity can be deposited in vaults of a lower rarity. Continuing the example above, one of your Gold Knights can be deposited in Gold vault and the other can be deposited in either Copper vault or Silver vault and earn APR corresponding to those vaults. Furthermore, for Knight NFTs put in Farming vaults, we shall use the ""Polish Mechanism”. After depositing Knight NFTs in those vaults, users must check their Knights on a regular basis through the Farming site, which is considered a polishing action. If users never check their Knights, the Glossiness of their Knights will deteriorate, and the Farming rewards will drop. So, to maintain the rewards from Knight NFTs, NFT owners must perform ""polishing"" action, which means check their NFTs in the vaults regularly. : Formula to calculate Farming rewards How to calculate the rewards for Copper, Silver and Gold Vaults? Each vault has a value called emissionPerSecond . This is a fixed amount that all depositors will be rewarded when they deposit NFT per second. Therefore, the fewer number of people staking NFT, the more rewards each staker will get. How to calculate the rewards for Diamond and Crystal Vaults? The Glossiness of each NFT starts off at 100%, but it gradually decreases over time, affecting the incentives received when users deposit their NFTs in the vault. Users must complete ""Polishing"" acts in order to receive 100% of the rewards. The amount of reward from NFT polishing shall be calculated using 2 parameters: decayRate and decayInterval . Concretely, after a decayInterval (a certain amount of time), if the NFT is not polished, the rewards for the next decayInterval will be reduced ( decayRate , calculated in % will decrease) For example: decayInterval = 2 days and decayRate = 10% indicates that: every two days without polishing, the rewards of the next day will be reduced (due to the NFT glossiness). Hence, after 20 days, the amount of rewards for NFT will be 0. If you stake NFT for a period t = 9, the amount of incentives that you probably get is 450 Trava (On average per day you will get 450/9 = 50). However, you have forgotten to polish for 9 days. Then, the amount of rewards you receive is only 370 Trava. The amount of incentive you get is described as below: Minus Rewards 10% 10% 20% 20% 30% 30% 40% Remaining Rewards(TRAVA) The detailed calculation us as follows: (X is the rewards NFT depositor will receive after t days) The average rewards each day NFT staker will receive: m=m = \\frac{X}{t} Number of decayInterval that depositor have to go through: n=tdecayIntervaln = \\frac{t}{decayInterval}decayInterval\u200b The result of this calculation will be rounded down.', 'PreviousBRicher User GuideNextveTRAVA Marketplace User Guide Last updated 1 year ago Was this helpful?', '_To provide users with more services in the Trava Ecosystem, we have planned to implement the Trava minigame series.

After the Trava Lottery and Battlehand, the next game — Fortune Mining, will be soon published on September 8th 2022. Introduction to fortune mining What is Fortune Mining? As mentioned, this is an important component of the Trava Minigame Series. The game is built on the well-known blockchain idea of the No-loss-rewards game, allowing participants to earn big prizes without worrying about losing their money. How does it work? So how exactly does Fortune Mining work? For more details, users first need to deposit their money into the Fortune Mining Pool. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm). That means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones. The benefit Fortune Mining brings to players. _No loss to worry about_: As the old saying goes, “More risk brings higher return.” However, with Fortune Mining, players will not need to worry about their losses. Because of the unique mechanism, there will be no loss, and unlucky players can get their deposits back after a certain period. _Big prize to look for_: While there is no loss to be concerned about, the winner may earn significantly more benefits than they would if they had deposited into the regular pool. For example , assuming that we run a Fortune Mining pool for users to deposit DAI and gain 20.000 DAI in total deposited after one week. With APY at 1.5% (that is converted to APR at about 0,92%) and APR at 4.08%, respectively, two weeks later, the total reward for the winner will be calculated as: _20000 (0.92%+ 4.08%)/365 14 = 38.356 DAI._ That means if you deposit 100 DAI at first and become the lucky one, you will receive about $38,356 (the interest rate at about 1000%) instead of $0,19 (the interest rate at about 5%). As in the example above, the gap between the rewards you could get in a normal pool and the Fortune Mining pool is very significant. For that reason, this mini-game will be a good choice for those with small capital to try their luck and get much more money than usual. To sum up, what do you need to do to attain the benefits? Step 1. Deposit your token into the Fortune Mining Pool Step 2. Waiting for a certain period (depending on each campaign) Step 3 . Check the result: * If you are the lucky one: Congratulations, you get all the rewards from the pool * If you have not been lucky yet, don’t worry, you can withdraw your deposit or keep them in the pool, then try your luck in the next period. Notes: We will soon run a voting snapshot for our community to decide which asset should be put in the Fortune Mining pool. Stay tuned for that.

We will recalculate and update the price based on the price on the market, the initial price and the data analysis extracted from our NFT Marketplace. Note that with each wallet, the maximum number of Trava Knight NFT that can be deposited in one vault is one Knight NFT. For example, if you have two Trava Knight NFTs of Gold, for example, you can only stake one of them into Gold Vault to farm and earn $TRAVA rewards. With Copper, Silver and Gold Vault, if NFT owners withdraw their NFTs within 7 days, the farming rewards will decrease by 10%. Knights with a higher rarity can be deposited in vaults of a lower rarity. Continuing the example above, one of your Gold Knights can be deposited in Gold vault and the other can be deposited in either Copper vault or Silver vault and earn APR corresponding to those vaults. Furthermore, for Knight NFTs put in Farming vaults, we shall use the ""Polish Mechanism”. After depositing Knight NFTs in those vaults, users must check their Knights on a regular basis through the Farming site, which is considered a polishing action. If users never check their Knights, the Glossiness of their Knights will deteriorate, and the Farming rewards will drop. So, to maintain the rewards from Knight NFTs, NFT owners must perform ""polishing"" action, which means check their NFTs in the vaults regularly. : Formula to calculate Farming rewards How to calculate the rewards for Copper, Silver and Gold Vaults? Each vault has a value called emissionPerSecond . This is a fixed amount that all depositors will be rewarded when they deposit NFT per second. Therefore, the fewer number of people staking NFT, the more rewards each staker will get. How to calculate the rewards for Diamond and Crystal Vaults? The Glossiness of each NFT starts off at 100%, but it gradually decreases over time, affecting the incentives received when users deposit their NFTs in the vault. Users must complete ""Polishing"" acts in order to receive 100% of the rewards. The amount of reward from NFT polishing shall be calculated using 2 parameters: decayRate and decayInterval . Concretely, after a decayInterval (a certain amount of time), if the NFT is not polished, the rewards for the next decayInterval will be reduced ( decayRate , calculated in % will decrease) For example: decayInterval = 2 days and decayRate = 10% indicates that: every two days without polishing, the rewards of the next day will be reduced (due to the NFT glossiness). Hence, after 20 days, the amount of rewards for NFT will be 0. If you stake NFT for a period t = 9, the amount of incentives that you probably get is 450 Trava (On average per day you will get 450/9 = 50). However, you have forgotten to polish for 9 days. Then, the amount of rewards you receive is only 370 Trava. The amount of incentive you get is described as below: Minus Rewards 10% 10% 20% 20% 30% 30% 40% Remaining Rewards(TRAVA) The detailed calculation us as follows: (X is the rewards NFT depositor will receive after t days) The average rewards each day NFT staker will receive: m=m = \\frac{X}{t} Number of decayInterval that depositor have to go through: n=tdecayIntervaln = \\frac{t}{decayInterval}decayInterval\u200b The result of this calculation will be rounded down.', 'Login × **Login Unsuccessful** × Looks like your connection to Trava Forum was lost, please wait while we try to reconnect.', '_To provide users with more services in the Trava Ecosystem, we have planned to implement the Trava minigame series.

After the Trava Lottery and Battlehand, the next game — Fortune Mining, will be soon published on September 8th 2022. Introduction to fortune mining What is Fortune Mining? As mentioned, this is an important component of the Trava Minigame Series. The game is built on the well-known blockchain idea of the No-loss-rewards game, allowing participants to earn big prizes without worrying about losing their money. How does it work? So how exactly does Fortune Mining work? For more details, users first need to deposit their money into the Fortune Mining Pool. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm). That means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones. The benefit Fortune Mining brings to players. _No loss to worry about_: As the old saying goes, “More risk brings higher return.” However, with Fortune Mining, players will not need to worry about their losses. Because of the unique mechanism, there will be no loss, and unlucky players can get their deposits back after a certain period. _Big prize to look for_: While there is no loss to be concerned about, the winner may earn significantly more benefits than they would if they had deposited into the regular pool. For example , assuming that we run a Fortune Mining pool for users to deposit DAI and gain 20.000 DAI in total deposited after one week. With APY at 1.5% (that is converted to APR at about 0,92%) and APR at 4.08%, respectively, two weeks later, the total reward for the winner will be calculated as: _20000 (0.92%+ 4.08%)/365 14 = 38.356 DAI._ That means if you deposit 100 DAI at first and become the lucky one, you will receive about $38,356 (the interest rate at about 1000%) instead of $0,19 (the interest rate at about 5%). As in the example above, the gap between the rewards you could get in a normal pool and the Fortune Mining pool is very significant. For that reason, this mini-game will be a good choice for those with small capital to try their luck and get much more money than usual. To sum up, what do you need to do to attain the benefits? Step 1. Deposit your token into the Fortune Mining Pool Step 2. Waiting for a certain period (depending on each campaign) Step 3 . Check the result: * If you are the lucky one: Congratulations, you get all the rewards from the pool * If you have not been lucky yet, don’t worry, you can withdraw your deposit or keep them in the pool, then try your luck in the next period. Notes: We will soon run a voting snapshot for our community to decide which asset should be put in the Fortune Mining pool. Stay tuned for that.

We will recalculate and update the price based on the price on the market, the initial price and the data analysis extracted from our NFT Marketplace. Note that with each wallet, the maximum number of Trava Knight NFT that can be deposited in one vault is one Knight NFT. For example, if you have two Trava Knight NFTs of Gold, for example, you can only stake one of them into Gold Vault to farm and earn $TRAVA rewards. With Copper, Silver and Gold Vault, if NFT owners withdraw their NFTs within 7 days, the farming rewards will decrease by 10%. Knights with a higher rarity can be deposited in vaults of a lower rarity. Continuing the example above, one of your Gold Knights can be deposited in Gold vault and the other can be deposited in either Copper vault or Silver vault and earn APR corresponding to those vaults. Furthermore, for Knight NFTs put in Farming vaults, we shall use the ""Polish Mechanism”. After depositing Knight NFTs in those vaults, users must check their Knights on a regular basis through the Farming site, which is considered a polishing action. If users never check their Knights, the Glossiness of their Knights will deteriorate, and the Farming rewards will drop. So, to maintain the rewards from Knight NFTs, NFT owners must perform ""polishing"" action, which means check their NFTs in the vaults regularly. : Formula to calculate Farming rewards How to calculate the rewards for Copper, Silver and Gold Vaults? Each vault has a value called emissionPerSecond . This is a fixed amount that all depositors will be rewarded when they deposit NFT per second. Therefore, the fewer number of people staking NFT, the more rewards each staker will get. How to calculate the rewards for Diamond and Crystal Vaults? The Glossiness of each NFT starts off at 100%, but it gradually decreases over time, affecting the incentives received when users deposit their NFTs in the vault. Users must complete ""Polishing"" acts in order to receive 100% of the rewards. The amount of reward from NFT polishing shall be calculated using 2 parameters: decayRate and decayInterval . Concretely, after a decayInterval (a certain amount of time), if the NFT is not polished, the rewards for the next decayInterval will be reduced ( decayRate , calculated in % will decrease) For example: decayInterval = 2 days and decayRate = 10% indicates that: every two days without polishing, the rewards of the next day will be reduced (due to the NFT glossiness). Hence, after 20 days, the amount of rewards for NFT will be 0. If you stake NFT for a period t = 9, the amount of incentives that you probably get is 450 Trava (On average per day you will get 450/9 = 50). However, you have forgotten to polish for 9 days. Then, the amount of rewards you receive is only 370 Trava. The amount of incentive you get is described as below: Minus Rewards 10% 10% 20% 20% 30% 30% 40% Remaining Rewards(TRAVA) The detailed calculation us as follows: (X is the rewards NFT depositor will receive after t days) The average rewards each day NFT staker will receive: m=m = \\frac{X}{t} Number of decayInterval that depositor have to go through: n=tdecayIntervaln = \\frac{t}{decayInterval}decayInterval\u200b The result of this calculation will be rounded down.', 'Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information). :', 'A Smart Wallet: Create your smart wallet here if you haven’t had it yet: https://app.trava.finance/station Next, you just need to do a simple thing: asking TravaGPT to deposit/ stake with Smart Wallet in Trava Finance lending pool/ Trava Staking and Trava Finance. ⚠️ Especially, remember to ensure this NOTE: When you stake/ deposit in Trava pools/vaults, you’ll have your own APR reward and PLUS 20% of the APR. HOWEVER: ✅ Leaving the reward in the vault until the campaign ends, you will earn an extra 20% APR. ❌ Withdrawing the reward before the campaign ends, you will NOT receive that extra 20% APR. Sixth Question: Many users are still confused a little bit about the Rewards of the campaign, especially the 20% APR PLUS. Could you give us a clear explanation for those rewards? The 20% APR PUS means that you will have an additional 20% of the APR you have when depositing/staking in Trava pool/vault. To make things simple, I will give you the formula for this reward: APR + (20% * APR) ** For example, when you stake tokens in Trava Staking and have 4.5% APR. In this campaign, you will not only have that 4.5% APR but also an additional 20% of that APR, which is 0.9% Remember that you also have Extra Rewards and Lottery Rewards, alongside the 20% APR PLUS. 👉 So let’s join us and get yourself in this LEADERBOARD: Answers community questions The AMA also provided insightful answers to the community’s questions on Twitter and during the event on Telegram.

That is why Trava Finance tops up contracts running out of Tokens, like bridge, staking vaults, LP vaults, lending contracts, manually by setting up notification bots to alert relevant Team members to complete the top-up. Additionally, Team is constantly reading the latest news and hacks happening in Crypto Space and investigating contract code particularities which were the point of attack. Another point - Trava Finance does not support flash loans due to flash loan attack possibilities, but other projects like AAVE do support them. That is why we do not see TRAVA as an asset within Lending Pools as using other project protocols it could lead to TRAVA\'s Token price downfall if it were to be used in flash loan attack scheme.

Indeed having $TRAVA as an asset to be able to Lend/Borrow via Lending Pools would provide the necessary utility. However as @theunreal has mentioned above, TRAVA Token cannot be added as an asset to Lending Pools as of this moment at least due a few reasons. Trava Finance does not support flash loans in Lending Pools, but other project protocols like AAVE do. By staging a flash loan attack via other project protocols users could destroy TRAVA price like it happened with CREAM for example. Current low price, current low circulating supply does not allow TRAVA to be an asset in Lending Pools quite yet. But that is why TraDAO ($TOD) should take it\'s place in the near future as an asset to be available for Lend/Borrow since it\'s backed up by a Treasury controlled by TraDAO protocol itself.

Creating a user-friendly landing page is one of the priorities for better user experience. Additionally, Trava Finance lending product team should start working on adding more tokens to ""Token Health"" so they could be added to pool creation once the product is 100% finished - having more tokens available for pool creation feature is an advantage to attract more userbase and investors.

As most of us Trava Finance users are already providing TRAVA Tokens to liquidity vaults, governance vaults, staking vaults but it is not reflected in BRicher. Shows that I have 0 strategies currently used, which is not true. I have Tokens in Governance vaults (locked), in Staking Vaults (locked), Tokens in Lending Pools but BRicher still implies I have zero strategies active right now. Would be great if you could read information from the wallet after authenticating it on BRicher, to list already used strategies.

Unfortunately, we cannot comment on any potential exchange listing platform or timeline. What we can confirm is that negotiations are happening and new CEX listing is always in plans, but requires good market conditions and approvals from both parties first, the exchange and the project. Kraken Listing on Kraken Exchange is pretty much impossible, they do not list Tokens randomly and the asset count available is low compared to other exchanges plus most of them are 100 Top assets. Etoro Same as Kraken, the asset size list available for trading is low and only selected few are available. Again at least 100 Top Tokens. Gate Exchange could theoretically damage the price of TRAVA Token due to airdrops for their exchange users, which they dump immediately after event is completed, plus projects have to donate Tokens for this event. MEXC and Bitmart listing are a perfect example. Plus Gate is not that renown, there are better exchanges to look at. LBank Same logic as Gate. Binance and KuCoin These two exchanges are more likely to be on the list for the Trava Team to do negotiations with. Though listings on both exchanges are quite costly. But if I had to guess, these two exchanges are more likely to happen than any of the above.

BRicher ensures the transparency, clarity, and completeness of the strategy information. We provide all relevant information related to every single step of a composite strategy , and you can easily verify it by yourselves. This article provides readers with a thorough guideline to use BRicher effectively. Website: https://app.trava.finance/bricher/ BRicher includes three main pages: Home, Strategy Exploring and Portfolio. Home page introduction: The Home page lists the best one-step investment strategies for all tokens supported by BRicher. Information on each strategy, such as its current ROI, ROI history, transaction fee and reward tokens are shown in the table. In addition, you can select a row to get detailed information on the respective strategy. At the right upper corner of the page, you can enter your favorite token to filter strategies. To sort the strategies, you can press on the table headers. Strategy Exploring: In this section, you can search for high-return investment strategies based on your input tokens. Every time you access this page, BRicher automatically calculates and presents the best strategies to you. Step 1. To use the Strategy Exploring page, you must connect and authenticate your wallet first: - Click the “Connect wallet” button, choose a wallet, enter your password and confirm. - Then click the “Authenticate” button. Step 2. Select the token you prefer to invest in by clicking one option under the line “Select token to invest”. Step 3. Select “More setting” to filter the recommended strategies * First, you can sort strategies by safety index, ROI, or the number of steps of the strategies. You can also set the limit for the number of steps used in your strategies. Strategies with a low number of steps are typically safer, but strategies with a high number of steps are usually more profitable. By default, recommended strategies are automatically composed of all yield farming methods. If you do not like a specific method, please deselect it. Some vaults/pools offer very high ROI, and they thus dominate the recommended strategies. To explore the other strategies that DO NOT include these vaults/pools, you can add the reward tokens of the vaults/pools to the control. Step 4. Click the “Make strategies” button * Our algorithm will automatically compute and return appropriate strategies to you. You should pay more attention to the strategy title (which includes names of used DApps), the safety index, the number of steps, and the Return On Investment rate. Make Investment: After exploring the recommended strategies, if you are interested in a strategy, please click its “Check detail and Invest” button. BRicher will show general information on the strategy, such as its start and expiration date, reward tokens, estimated gas, ROI history, etc. BRicher also displays all helpful information on each step. The relevant information is shown depending on the type of method used in the step (staking, depositing, borrowing, providing liquidity pair, swapping). All of them are real-time data collected by BRicher that can save time in making decisions. There are three methods to make a strategy: manual investing, semi-auto investing and auto investing. The basic difference between these three is the level that BRicher supports you to make your investment. * Manual Investing: You need to access each DApps to implement each step by yourself. * Semi-auto Investing: You only need to stay on the BRicher site, and for each step, you simply click on an “Execute” button. * Auto Investing: All you need to do is click on one button to authorize BRicher to complete the whole process. : Manual investing Step 1. Fill in the amount of capital you want to invest: Step 2.

Fill in the amount of capital you want to invest Step 2. Click the “Semi-auto Invest” button Step 3. A list of steps will appear. You can simply finish the progress by clicking each “Execute” button related to each step. Notes: If errors occur, there will be pop-up messages and instructions. Users can follow this instruction to continue investing or cancel the investment. Users can only execute one investment strategy at one time. That means they must finish or cancel the previous investing progress if they want to implement the other plans. Users can implement their strategies and quit the page in the middle.

The starting point of the solid line represents the time you start your strategy. It also displays other interesting information on your strategy that you can monitor. : “Your Investment” section This section will display key metrics related to users’ investing plans across different DApps.

Additionally, Team is constantly reading the latest news and hacks happening in Crypto Space and investigating contract code particularities which were the point of attack. Another point - Trava Finance does not support flash loans due to flash loan attack possibilities, but other projects like AAVE do support them.

These past few months have shown there could be a collapse of the chain if its ever found that Binance is having financial difficulties or serious legal issues. I feel we should maybe increase our exposure to just ETH and BTC instead and minority stake in BNB. Also it may be wise to follow what Iron Bank has done and keep adding more networks for the platform use. Avax, Algo, etc., in case BNB falls it won't harm Trava as bad. Currently most of the transactions on Trava are on the BNB chain.

Vision of TOD: The Future of Trava Capital is an important pillar of our ecosystem, helping in the plan to implement various blockchain and crypto investment strategies for the benefit of the whole community. With the market gradually improving and Trava Finance orienting itself as an AI-driven lending station, Trava Capital must also step up to keep up with these grand developments. TOD holders play an important role in this mechanism, leading to concern for its future in particular, and Trava Capital as a whole in general. Continue reading below to learn about our plans for 2024 and beyond. TOD TOD is the reserve currency of Trava Capital, and as you may remember, it has been launched in a token pair before — TOD/BUSD. It has also gone through impressive periods of excellence with outstanding results, bringing many benefits to holders. However, with the changing market and the gradual loss of popularity of BUSD over time, Trava Team has a proposal for its future. We intend to cancel the listing for TOD/BUSD, and switch to another pair, which is TOD/USDT. With Listing Liquidity still remaining over $100K, Trava Finance hopes that this will not be a difficult change. It would be even better if TRAVA/TOD Listing Liquidity Call could achieve the number that our team is looking for, prompting the listing of this pair to also be carried out accordingly. Trava Capital As the crypto market rides the bullish wave, opportunities abound for projects like Trava Finance to capitalize on the favorable market conditions. In particular, Trava Capital is in a prime position in the ongoing trend, with its focus on optimizing capital investment and benefiting its stakeholders. That’s why finding a smart mechanism to collect and use capital is becoming even more urgent. It will not only help increase profits, but also provide liquidity and invest in profitable resources, thereby increasing the number of holders. In the next stage, Trava Capital is expected to bring more features to enhance decentralized market-making strategies on Web3, aiming for success in the dynamic DeFi space. These features are hoped to empower stakeholders in Trava Capital to deploy more complex strategies, collectively leveraging the protocol’s investing models: * Multiple Concentrated Liquidity Positions: Allowing deployment of a custom positions collection, instead of just a single position, enabling the creation of more diverse and complex investment strategies. This gives place for more creativity, freedom and personalization of users in Trava Capital. * Cross-fee Rates: Allowing LPs to allocate their liquidity across multiple fee rates simultaneously within a single liquidity pool. LPs can optimize their exposure to different trading volumes and price ranges within the same pool, based on factors such as trading volume, volatility, and expected profitability. * Inventory Management: Overseeing and deciding if the proportion of a vault’s assets is exposed to market risk at all times. It’s optional to add or remove inventory from the market, adjusting based on volume or volatility. This enhances Trava Capital’s risk management capabilities and strategy effectiveness. * Cross Protocol Rebalancing: Supporting rebalancing of inventory composition across different protocols or DEXs. This capability allows stakeholders to optimize liquidity provision by moving assets between liquidity sources. By minimizing slippage, this feature enhances the efficiency of Trava Capital’s investing strategies. In the evolving landscape of DeFi, the concentration of its capital market in blockchain networks like Ethereum and Arbitrum presents both challenges and opportunities. Recognizing their growing prominence, as well as the need to adapt and capitalize on emerging trends, Trava Capital is planning to expand its operations to ETH and Arbitrum. With this move, we aim to tap into a broader pool of liquidity, access new investment opportunities, and enhance the efficiency of our capital deployment strategies. This plan is our commitment to keep Trava Capital staying at the forefront in the DeFi space and delivering value to its stakeholders in an ever-evolving market environment. About Trava.Finance Trava Finance is an AI-driven Lending Station. As the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending, we provide both lending pools like normal approaches, and a more flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own pools.

Step 2. Select the token you prefer to invest in by clicking one option under the line “Select token to invest”. Step 3.

Strategies with a low number of steps are typically safer, but strategies with a high number of steps are usually more profitable. By default, recommended strategies are automatically composed of all yield farming methods. If you do not like a specific method, please deselect it. Some vaults/pools offer very high ROI, and they thus dominate the recommended strategies. To explore the other strategies that DO NOT include these vaults/pools, you can add the reward tokens of the vaults/pools to the control. Step 4.

Firstly, one Minor and Two Informational Issues concern some coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused functions, missing zero addresses checking, and function type. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues. Secondly, all four Major Issues are related to Centralization. The owners of the following contracts below can execute some functions without obtaining the consensus of the community: * FactoryRegistry, * AddressesProviderFactory * PoolUpdateControl * LendingPoolConfigurator Certik Recommendations for the Centralization Issue:: Certik advised to carefully manage the governance/guardian account’s private key to avoid any potential risks of being hacked. In general, Certik strongly recommended centralized privileges or roles in the protocol to be improved via a decentralized mechanism or via smart-contract-based accounts with enhanced security practices, e.g. Multisignature wallets. Some feasible solutions recommended by Certik that would also mitigate the potential risk include: * Time-lock with reasonable latency, i.e. 48 hours, for awareness on privileged operations; * Assignment of privileged roles to multi-signature wallets to prevent a single point of failure due to the private key; * Introduction of a DAO/governance/voting module to increase transparency and user involvement. Trava Solutions for the Centralization Issue: Trava has partially resolved these issues via smart-contract-based accounts. In particular: * Deploy a Multi-Signature wallet in BSC mainnet at the address: 0xdF73aC573Dfd430f4C5558B8CbeD86e86145501B * Set up the owner of the contracts and governance to the multi-signature wallet. Although these issues are major, our approach can avoid the potential risks of centralization. Moreover, in our roadmap, we will enable DAO Functionalities in Q2–2022. The introduction of the DAO module will completely resolve the centralization issues. This approach will make our community control the process and activity of Trava Finance in the near future.

In addition, you can select a row to get detailed information on the respective strategy. At the right upper corner of the page, you can enter your favorite token to filter strategies. To sort the strategies, you can press on the table headers. Strategy Exploring: In this section, you can search for high-return investment strategies based on your input tokens. Every time you access this page, BRicher automatically calculates and presents the best strategies to you. Step 1. To use the Strategy Exploring page, you must connect and authenticate your wallet first: - Click the “Connect wallet” button, choose a wallet, enter your password and confirm. - Then click the “Authenticate” button. Step 2. Select the token you prefer to invest in by clicking one option under the line “Select token to invest”. Step 3. Select “More setting” to filter the recommended strategies * First, you can sort strategies by safety index, ROI, or the number of steps of the strategies. You can also set the limit for the number of steps used in your strategies. Strategies with a low number of steps are typically safer, but strategies with a high number of steps are usually more profitable. By default, recommended strategies are automatically composed of all yield farming methods. If you do not like a specific method, please deselect it. Some vaults/pools offer very high ROI, and they thus dominate the recommended strategies. To explore the other strategies that DO NOT include these vaults/pools, you can add the reward tokens of the vaults/pools to the control. Step 4. Click the “Make strategies” button * Our algorithm will automatically compute and return appropriate strategies to you. You should pay more attention to the strategy title (which includes names of used DApps), the safety index, the number of steps, and the Return On Investment rate.

BRicher will show general information on the strategy, such as its start and expiration date, reward tokens, estimated gas, ROI history, etc. BRicher also displays all helpful information on each step.

Creating a user-friendly landing page is one of the priorities for better user experience.

Creating a user-friendly landing page is one of the priorities for better user experience. Additionally, Trava Finance lending product team should start working on adding more tokens to ""Token Health"" so they could be added to pool creation once the product is 100% finished - having more tokens available for pool creation feature is an advantage to attract more userbase and investors. Lastly, I like the (idea 4.) - creating more DeFi investment options to explore in DeFi Cryptospace is great for expanding community knowledge about investment possibilities and also making the BRicher tool more flexible.

Trava Administration 3 Jul 2024, 21:00 * Trava Capital — Renovation & Innovation posted in Others 1. Idea: Starting from TraDAO and turning into Trava Capital, its growth is closely connected to our community. Correspondingly, when technology reaches another high and the market is in a bullish phase with many opportunities awaiting, it’s time for renovation and innovation. Therefore, our team has discussed carefully and had the first thoughts about the updates we can make with Trava Capital. We intend to separate it from Trava Finance into its own being — an AI platform that enables running liquidity provision strategies on blockchains. But no matter which direction we go, our ultimate goal is still to benefit users and the entire Trava ecosystem. Our community is always the center. 2. Information: Trava Capital is an important pillar of our ecosystem, which currently provides users with two main investment models — Treasury and Crowdfunding. It has been and is still bringing benefits to the community, however, our team foresees its even brighter future. Our goal is to build a trustless market-making infrastructure & strategies on DEX V3, as well as Lending pool on multi-chains, with the integration of AI technology. From there, Liquidity providers can utilize our features to have their liquidity managed in an automated, capital-efficient, non-custodial, and transparent manner. We hope to democratize market-making, enabling DEXs and Lending to become the primary trading venue for all assets, even beyond crypto. 3. Ask for Suggestions: During this initial ideation stage, the features we can propose include: * Multiple Concentrated Liquidity Positions * Cross-fee tier Vaults * Inventory Management * Non-Custodial * … and more. So what do you think about this new renovation and innovation plan for Trava Capital? With the new goal of becoming an AI platform that enables running liquidity provision strategies on blockchains as mentioned above, what features do you think we should add?""]","['https://app.trava.finance/station/tramlines/owner', 'https://docs.trava.finance/trava-station/tramlines', 'https://app.trava.finance/station/tramlines', 'https://gov.trava.finance/topic/61.rss', 'https://gov.trava.finance/uid/11']",['https://docs.trava.finance/trava-station/tramlines']

Now, Trava Station does help reduce the time-consuming steps of changing dApps, but you still need to drag and drop from the start again. Or you would have to spend time figuring out which actions are required and in what order. All these operations can be so boring and laborious. Therefore, we would like to introduce Tramlines, a new feature added into Trava Station on October 11, 2023 👉 https://app.trava.finance/station/tramlines.

This new product marks another step in the evolution of Trava Finance, closer to fulfilling our goal of a convenient and seamless DeFi environment. The first Testnet version of Trava Station comes with two features: Freight and Portfolio. After testing and collecting user opinions, Tramlines and Junction will be added, preparing for the release on Mainnet. Trava Station is live on Testnet You can continue with the content below to understand more about Trava Station and the 2 features that have been launched. We’ll also go over the benefits of Trava Station again, providing a few small examples of the fee difference between using Trava Station and not. Check out Trava Station here: https://app.trava.finance/station Freight As in the published content, this is a feature that allows users to combine many actions in the Trava Finance ecosystem into a single transaction. Trava Freight allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands, with simple options like drag and drop, click… to put actions into a route. After that, you just need to fill in the corresponding necessary parameters and you’re done, for example as shown in the image below. Currently in this Testnet version, Freight allows basic actions and interactions with Trava Finance’s Lending Pools, BNB chain… We are still continuing to polish the product, adding more actions related to NFT and launching together in the Mainnet version. Of course, we won’t stop just there, but will develop Freight even more in the future. So if you have any suggestion, say it so we Trava team can check and maybe work on them. Portfolio In order for Trava Station and its features to work smoothly, we integrated Smart Wallet in our system, with more detailed information can be found in our previous article. You will be asked to create a Smart Wallet the first time joining Trava Station, and it will act as an intermediary for all your actions, temporarily holding your assets. To make it easier for you to track Smart Wallet position and assets, we have added the Portfolio feature. This feature will display your position in the Lending Pool when you use Smart Wallet to perform actions in the pools in the Trava ecosystem. Or if you create an order to sell Armoury items, Portfolio will display those NFTs for sale, and the amount of money you have in your Smart Wallet from the sale. With more actions and features added in the future, the Portfolio page will also show more user information and details related to the Station. Upcoming features As mentioned in the product ideas overview in our Forum, Trava Station has a total of 4 main features in plan. In addition to the two mentioned above will be in this Testnet version, we also intend to bring Tramlines and Junction in the future. * Among them, the former is a collection of pre-made routes with actions that are commonly used. We will soon make an announcement on consulting users about Tramlines, so stay tuned to not miss it. * Meanwhile, the Junction feature is for routes that work in the future — they won’t run when created like with Freight. You can specify one or some conditions, and a system bot will monitor them and execute them when the parameters are reached. For example, you can set actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price gets to $1000 — this threshold appearing will signal our system bot to execute the pre-arranged actions. The benefits Trava Station is intended to reduce both the time you spend switching between Trava platforms, and the fee of making multiple transactions. Normally, to accomplish a certain goal such as staking into Trava Finance’s Vault, you will have to supply, swap and stake in turn. It seems easy with just a few actions, but there can be times when the goal requires up to a dozen, each happening on different platforms, wasting you a lot of precious time. That’s not to mention the amount of fees you have to pay to perform separate transactions — because usually you cannot execute another action if you have a pending one. But now with Trava Station, things will become much simpler and more economical, when various actions can be combined into a single transaction. The fee difference Here are a few example actions to show the difference between the fee you will spend using Trava Station versus not using it: * 2 actions: If you perform repay (token DAI) and withdraw (token AAVE) in Trava Station, the cost will be 0.001530189 BNB — 10.83% less than the normal gas fee of 0.001716111 BNB.', ': Markets overview: Market * Governance overview: Governance * Station overview: Partnership Campaign Station * GPT overview: Trava GPT Ecosystem NetworkConnect Wallet Tramlines Tramlines provide a list of pre-made routes of common actions for you to import.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

But there is still a lot to do on the journey of becoming a Decentralized Lending Marketplace waiting ahead, especially with the rapid development of technology today. To give Trava Knights a thorough look into the future plan of Trava Finance for 2024, we have created this Roadmap. The Final Quarter of 2023 In the fourth quarter of 2023, Trava Finance had plans to release Tramlines for Trava Station , and already successfully executed it. This feature offers various preset Routes of most common actions in the Trava ecosystem, enabling users to perform investment strategies much faster and easier. Our next addition is Web3 Portfolio , which will allow users to have full control over their current DeFi assets and lending position. This feature can be said to be an upgraded and consolidated version of our dApps, giving users a unified view of their portfolio, making it easier to track and manage their investments. We will also introduce Lending Analytics — it will provide powerful views for users about lending protocols on the market, including finance and user aspects. This feature allows you to track your lending position, performance, and other data, giving detailed insights into lending activities of end users to help empower our AI model. The First Quarter of 2024 At the beginning of 2024, Trava Team will put a lot of effort into launching Trava Junction , the final feature in Station that allows users to create transactions in advance that only automatically execute when a preset condition(s) is met. We will release Ver. 1 of Junction in the first quarter, with the Monitoring User Position function. Trava Team has also been making preparations from now to launch User Portfolio and Position Alerts — to further enhance user experience. In general, they are two tools that will help you monitor more closely your personal data and lending positions, thereby staying on top of your investment game and making timely decisions. Another crucial milestone in the first Quarter of 2024 will be the release of Lending Recommendation by AI , with the first step being Protocols Suggestion . This is the place where BRicher and Trava Station meet each other — Based on your portfolio, Bricher will recommend the potential and suitable lending actions for users. The Second Quarter of 2024 In the following Quarter, we will be building on the success of our previous releases with some updates. First is Tramlines Suggestion for Trava Station, an addition to Lending Recommendation by AI . With this, a new era of Trava ecosystems will be fully set in, and new opportunities in the community are going to be established. In the same Quarter, we will be introducing Trends Alerts and News Capturing . The former will aggregate all news related to lending pools and provide to our Users. Meanwhile, the latter will alert users when there is anyone on chain trends relevant to lending protocols to users. In the second quarter of 2024, users can also experience Ver. 2 of Trava Junction , now added with Automating User Actions to make user financial experience more seamless and efficient. With this development, our AI-driven system will analyze and evaluate aggregated data, from which to choose and perform the most appropriate actions for you under your permission. The Third Quarter of 2024 For the latter half of the following year, we have planned some exciting new features and updates for our users. In general, Trava Finance will focus quite a bit on upgrading different aspects of Trava Station , especially applying Generative AI in its ecosystem. We will strive to expand the availability of Trava Apps, which will bring users an even more secure, smooth, and exciting experience in DeFi. Trava Team will carry out the Trava Junction for Pool Creation , which gives users more control and flexibility over their investment decisions in the Trava ecosystem. Two other features are more closely related to Tramlines, the former of which is an update of Lending Recommendation with Tramlines creation by AI . The other is Personalized Tramlines by AI , which will provide users with relevant and customized financial recommendations based on their financial history and credit score. The Fourth Quarter of 2024 We have some cutting-edge technology planned for our users to experience in the final quarter of 2024. Our TramlinesGPT and JunctionGPT will be the most direct results of the AI technology developed by Trava Finance. These features will enable conditional interaction between the users and Trava Station, utilizing natural language processing and machine learning to give users the best answers and suggestions. Conclusion The year 2023 has seen some downs, but the important thing is that we continue to grow strongly, and closer to the goal of Decentralized Lending Marketplace. 2024 is predicted to be the year of potential opportunities for Trava Finance and the crypto market, with the content of the Station Roadmap mentioned above.

Idea As announced recently, we are preparing to launch the Trava Station. Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. 2. Information Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, Freight is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes Smart Wallet , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the main interface of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don’t have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA. With Trava Freight, all those laborious, time-consuming and costly steps can be combined into a single transaction. In the current version, the scope of implementation with Freight in particular and Trava Station in general is still quite limited, mainly focusing on Lending Pool, Marketplaces, users' wallets… The actions include borrowing, returning assets, adding liquidity or withdrawing, executing conversion orders, buying or selling NFTs, tokens or other digital assets. Of course, we will develop the platform further, add more activities and features in the future, so that everyone has a truly seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. Portfolio is where you can keep track of your position and all your assets in Smart Wallet in Trava Station. Tramlines and Junction are complementary features to Freight, in which Tramlines provide a list of pre-made sequences with arranged actions for you to import. Meanwhile, Junction consists of sequences that are not executed when you create, but are made active by a system bot only when a condition is reached. * For example, you can create a set of actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price reaches $1000 — so when this threshold appears, our system bot will execute the pre-arranged actions. 3. Ask After reading the above information, you may have understood a little more about Trava Station and our vision, right? We treasure all your opinions, because you are who Trava Station was built to serve. So let us know what you think about this upcoming product, suggesting for further development!! And look forward to the launch of Trava Station on August 24, 2023 . Trava Administration 11 Aug 2023, 21:06 * Idea Contest Discussion posted in Governance Idea: So, the Idea Contest has ended, and we are very happy to have received the enthusiastic participation of many members. There are those who gave not only one but dozens of different opinions, on many aspects and products of Trava Finance. From there, we have selected 10 ideas to proceed further: 1. Open a contest for community members to create their own knights. 2. Restructure the main page of Trava, removing the mountains with links to make it seem more user-friendly and easier to understand Trava's focus. 3. Expand to other chains and add new ones, since BNB is in a potentially risky position. 4. Add more DeFi protocols to BRicher, regularly updating good protocols and removing unsafe ones. 5. Simplify the parameters in Lending Pools and add more tokens. Add a type of notification so people would know when liquidations are close. 6. Increase the utility of TRAVA tokens by adding continuous token burn feature, periodically burning minted TRAVA. Allow them to be exchanged on all chains in Trava Lending. 7. Reopen BNB/Trava safety passbook. 8. Launch Knights leasing feature. 9. Do Idea Contest more periodically. 10. Start marketing on Crew3. Motivation: Each of the ideas has been thoroughly researched by us, evaluated for their potential and feasibility. Don't be sad if your ideas are not here, they might just be slightly deviating from Trava Finance's development orientation, or not yet capable of being put into practice. This discussion is open in order to be able to involve the whole community in contributing to the development of Trava Finance. It’s expected to be a stepping stone before starting the voting snapshot, for everyone to dive deeper into these ideas and voice their own comments. From there, it is also possible for you to pick the best choices for the development of Trava, choosing a worthy winner (or winners). The founders and POs of Trava Finance will also check out this discussion, so don't be afraid to dig into each issue and ask the hard questions.

']","['Utilizing Smart Wallet in Trava Station system: Embracing the future: Published in 4 min readAug 19, 2023 Share As reported in the recent topic about Trava Station in the Forum, we have introduced you to some information about this new product. In it, we mentioned the need for a feature so that we can combine various actions in a single transaction — Smart Wallet. Utilizing Smart Wallet in Trava Station system However, many people may not understand their fundamental mechanisms and profound benefits, and that is why we have this article. Follow along with the content below to answer questions surrounding Smart Wallet, and clarify the importance of it in the Trava Station system. Unveiling the Smart Wallet At its core, a smart wallet is an advanced digital tool designed to enhance the way we store, manage, and interact with our financial assets. Each smart wallet is created and owned by the user, representing them (their proxy) and ensuring absolute control over its operations. Departing from the standard Web3 wallets, smart wallets eliminate the need for private keys or seed phrases, instead rely on smart contracts. These intricate computer programs run on a blockchain, operate based on predefined rules and conditions. Conditions and access permissions are encoded into these self-executing code, rendering Smart Wallet both secure and adaptable for managing financial resources. Smart Wallet and Trava Station When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create a Smart Wallet. To understand why, we must first look at the essence of Trava Station — a transit point for performing actions in one go. Normally, you will have to execute and pay a fee for separate transactions on blockchain, as you cannot perform another action if you have a pending one. In response to that, this upcoming product is intended to reduce both the time you spend switching between Trava platforms, and the fee of making multiple transactions. With Trava Station, your assets will be put into Smart Wallet to be evaluated according to the sequences of actions and parameters you set. It now acts as an intermediary so that the requests of the users can be calculated and fulfilled in one go, making the experience much smoother. While using Trava Station, your assets will be temporarily held in Smart Wallet, then returned to your Main Wallet (Metamask, Trust Wallet,…) after the process is over. Trava Station’s features with Smart Wallet: Our Smart Wallet can serve as a stay point of your assets when you perform some special actions in the Trava ecosystem. For example, when you create an action with Freight in Trava Station to sell Armoury items, the money won’t immediately go into your Smart Wallet. The NFT will stay there until someone buys it on the Marketplace, at which point the process ends and now your Smart Wallet will hold the money from that sale. Trava Station’s Smart Wallet allows users to create their own routes to execute actions within and between Trava Finance protocols efficiently, particularly with Freight. In addition, there are pre-made routes that you can import from Tramlines to freely use. Smart Wallet also supports storing pre-set rules for specific conditions, which best shows in Junction. This feature includes sequences that won’t run right when you create them, but will be triggered by the system bot when a condition is reached. You can also track all the assets in your Smart Wallet in the Portfolio section of Trava Station. This feature will display your position in the Lending Pool when you use Smart Wallet to perform actions in the pools in the Trava ecosystem. Or as with the example mentioned above — you create an order to sell Armoury items, Portfolio will display those NFTs for sale, and the amount of money you have in your Smart Wallet. Pervasive Benefits of Smart Wallets Smart Wallet is absolutely necessary for Trava Station to work. It provides a smoother DeFi experience by allowing users to combine several transactions into one, minimizing the fee of performing multiple actions at the same time, and so on. Smart Wallet brings more convenient experience while still offering enhanced security, satisfying not only new users but also experienced ones. Thanks to the versatility of smart contracts, it can break user reliance on private keys, offer advantageous new features and provide a better experience. In their development, Smart Wallets also presented a number of other uses, such as allowing multisig transactions, or extra layer of security through authenticating apps. They are also capable of limiting daily transaction amounts, reducing the possibility of costly errors and stopping attackers from emptying your wallet. These are all potential benefits of Smart Wallet that can be applied to Trava Station, which have been looked into and / or currently being developed by the Trava team. Conclusion Smart Wallet marks a pivotal juncture in our journey, offering heightened security and streamlined accessibility for Trava Station. We stand poised to significantly enhance your DeFi experience, formulating an effective ecosystem amidst this evolving landscape. With the release of this product, Trava Finance looks forward to bringing you the most convenience, minimizing costs and time for users’ transactions. 🌟So let’s countdown to Trava Station launch on August 24, 2023 .

How much should I keep my health factor at to avoid liquidation penalty?,0.904,True,"['How to avoid being liquidated?  In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2.']","[""Introduction: In borrowing, when a borrowers’ health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value, a liquidation process might happen. In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty? : The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated? : In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2. PreviousTesting TravaNextTroubleshooting Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?"", 'Is Borrowing assets more beneficial than Selling? : If you sell your assets, you will lose the possession of this particular asset. It means you would be no longer entitled to the potential upside value gain. Whereas, by borrowing, you can still obtain these potential earnings (working capital) without losing your asset. You can borrow when unexpected expenses happen and leverage your holding assets for other investment opportunities. How to borrow? : In order to borrow, you need to deposit any asset to be used as collateral first (check out the Depositing & Earning FAQ section for more info). After depositing, you simply go to the “Borrow” section and click the “Borrow” button on the asset you want to borrow. Input the amount and approve the transaction. The borrowed amount is based on the available deposits that you used as collateral. What is the maximum amount can I borrow? : The maximum amount you can borrow depends on your deposited value and the available liquidity. Please notice the health factor and liquidation threshold indicators to guarantee your collaterals are in the state of safety. Besides, you can not borrow if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor is too low. What type of asset do I repay my loans? : When repaying a loan, the type of asset that you need to repay is in the same asset you borrowed. For example, if you borrow 1 BNB you will pay back 1 BNB plus interest accrued. Another way to pay back the loan is using your collateral. If you want to pay back the loan based on USD price you can borrow any of the available stable coins as USDC, DAI, USDT, etc. How much interest would I pay for my loans? : When borrowing, the interest rate you need to pay depends on the borrowing rate which is determined from the supply and demand ratio of the asset. Moreover, the interest rate is a variable rate so that it changes constantly. The current borrowing rate of your borrowed assets is shown in the Borrowing section of your dashboard, you can check it any time. What is Health factor? : Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation? : The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals. When do I need to repay the loan? : As long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan. However, the accrued interest of your borrowing will grow day by day, making your health factor decrease. When it reaches the threshold of liquidation, your deposited assets are more likely to fall into liquidation status. How to repay the loan? : In order to pay back the loan you go to the Borrowings section of your dashboard and click on the repay button for the asset you borrowed and want to repay. Select the amount to pay back and approve the transaction.

For example, if the LTV is 75%, borrowers will be allowed to borrow 0.75 ETH worth of corresponding currency for every 1 ETH worth of collateral. For a wallet, the maximum LTV is calculated as the weighted average of LTVs of collateral assets and their value. In particular, for a wallet that deposits the collateral assets that are worth in dollars ,…,C_1, \\dots ,C_n,…,, and their LTVs corresponding to LT,…,LTLTV_1, \\dots , LTV_nLT,…,LT, maximum LTV is ×LT+⋯+×LT+⋯+\\frac{C_1 \\times LTV_1 + \\cdots + C_n \\times LTV_n }{C_1+\\cdots+C_n}+⋯+×LT+⋯+×LT\u200b Liquidation Threshold: The liquidation threshold is the percentage at which a position is defined as undercollateralised. For example, a Liquidation threshold of 80% means that if the value rises above 80% of the collateral, the position is undercollateralised and could be liquidated. The difference between the Loan To Value and the Liquidation Threshold is a safety cushion for borrowers. For each wallet, the liquidation threshold is calculated as the weighted average of the liquidation thresholds of the collateral assets and their value. In particular, for a wallet that deposits the collateral assets that are worth in dollars ,…,C_1, \\dots ,C_n,…,, and their liquidation threshold, respectively, L,…,LLT_1, \\dots, LT_nL,…,L , the liquidation thresholds of wallet is ×L+⋯+×L+⋯+\\frac{C_1 \\times LT_1 + \\cdots + C_n \\times LT_n}{C_1 + \\cdots + C_n}+⋯+×L+⋯+×L\u200b Health Factor: For a wallet, these risk parameters enable the calculation of the health factor: =×L+⋯+×LBH_f = \\frac{C_1 \\times LT_1+ \\cdots + C_n \\times LT_n}{B}×L+⋯+×L\u200b where is total borrows (in dollars) , ,…,C_1,\\dots,C_n,…,is the values (in dollars) of collateral assets, and L,…,LLT_1, \\dots, LT_nL,…,L is their liquidation threshold, respectively. When 1H_f < 1 the loan may be liquidated to maintain solvency. Liquidation penalty: Liquidation penalty is a bonus applied to the price of collateral assets purchased by liquidators as part of the liquidation of a loan that has reached the liquidation threshold.

Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract. How does Trava price NFTs? : Trava will provide the auction function for NFT assets. Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way. We also avoid the price fluctuation of NFT because the NFTs have been priced in the auction contract before.

Idea As announced recently, we are preparing to launch the Trava Station. Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. 2. Information Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, Freight is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes Smart Wallet , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the main interface of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don’t have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA. With Trava Freight, all those laborious, time-consuming and costly steps can be combined into a single transaction. In the current version, the scope of implementation with Freight in particular and Trava Station in general is still quite limited, mainly focusing on Lending Pool, Marketplaces, users' wallets… The actions include borrowing, returning assets, adding liquidity or withdrawing, executing conversion orders, buying or selling NFTs, tokens or other digital assets. Of course, we will develop the platform further, add more activities and features in the future, so that everyone has a truly seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. Portfolio is where you can keep track of your position and all your assets in Smart Wallet in Trava Station. Tramlines and Junction are complementary features to Freight, in which Tramlines provide a list of pre-made sequences with arranged actions for you to import. Meanwhile, Junction consists of sequences that are not executed when you create, but are made active by a system bot only when a condition is reached. * For example, you can create a set of actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price reaches $1000 — so when this threshold appears, our system bot will execute the pre-arranged actions. 3. Ask After reading the above information, you may have understood a little more about Trava Station and our vision, right? We treasure all your opinions, because you are who Trava Station was built to serve. So let us know what you think about this upcoming product, suggesting for further development!! And look forward to the launch of Trava Station on August 24, 2023 . Trava Administration 11 Aug 2023, 21:06 * Idea Contest Discussion posted in Governance Idea: So, the Idea Contest has ended, and we are very happy to have received the enthusiastic participation of many members. There are those who gave not only one but dozens of different opinions, on many aspects and products of Trava Finance. From there, we have selected 10 ideas to proceed further: 1. Open a contest for community members to create their own knights. 2. Restructure the main page of Trava, removing the mountains with links to make it seem more user-friendly and easier to understand Trava's focus. 3. Expand to other chains and add new ones, since BNB is in a potentially risky position. 4. Add more DeFi protocols to BRicher, regularly updating good protocols and removing unsafe ones. 5. Simplify the parameters in Lending Pools and add more tokens. Add a type of notification so people would know when liquidations are close. 6. Increase the utility of TRAVA tokens by adding continuous token burn feature, periodically burning minted TRAVA. Allow them to be exchanged on all chains in Trava Lending. 7. Reopen BNB/Trava safety passbook. 8. Launch Knights leasing feature. 9. Do Idea Contest more periodically. 10. Start marketing on Crew3. Motivation: Each of the ideas has been thoroughly researched by us, evaluated for their potential and feasibility. Don't be sad if your ideas are not here, they might just be slightly deviating from Trava Finance's development orientation, or not yet capable of being put into practice. This discussion is open in order to be able to involve the whole community in contributing to the development of Trava Finance. It’s expected to be a stepping stone before starting the voting snapshot, for everyone to dive deeper into these ideas and voice their own comments. From there, it is also possible for you to pick the best choices for the development of Trava, choosing a worthy winner (or winners). The founders and POs of Trava Finance will also check out this discussion, so don't be afraid to dig into each issue and ask the hard questions.

Explain in details Trava governace v1 and the vision for version 2,0.9459,True,"['Governance v1  For version 1 of Trava Governance, we present evolution in governance processes with on-chain features enabled. Governance Process  The governance process consists of 2 continuous processes: off-chain & on-chain.      Off-chain process:  In the off-chain process, anyone in the Trava community can raise their opinions and discuss ideas of how the protocol can improve by creating TRC - Trava Request for Comments on the Trava Forum.  After an idea is well-formed, a community member can follow our template for TIP - Trava Improvement Proposal and post on the forum for details feedback. We recommend off-chain voting (powered by snapshot.org) to gain exposure and rough consensus from the community to increase the chance of succeeding in the on-chain process.  When a TIP gets to its final version, the DAO Committee is in charge of the review process and officially proposes on-chain.      On-chain process:  When a TIP is proposed on-chain, it becomes transparent on the public blockchain; anyone possessing voting power can directly vote for or against this proposal.  After the voting period, a TIP will be queued and executed by the public.  The Security Advisory Board acts as a guardian to prevent malicious actions and security exploits in this process. Governance Authority  In governance version 1, the DAO will have authority over the Trava lending protocol. The community will have to agree on any significant changes or updates through the on-chain process. Governance Power  To gain governance power, holders need to lock their Trava or rTrava token in exchange for the veTRAVA token, which holds voting power. This vote locking mechanism encourages users who show a solid commitment to the protocol with more governance power and incentive.', 'In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1  In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc.  In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including:      Discussion: In this stage, Trava holders will discuss different problems on the Trava Forum.     Proposal: On this forum, once a person brings his or her ideas to the platform, the community will determine whether they should be considered by up-voting this proposal. If the community approves, it will be brought on the snapshot in the next step.     Voting off-chain on the snapshot: On the snapshot, users will vote for the proposition they want.     Voting on-chain: After the voting on the snapshot, the whole governance process will then be generated totally on-chain.     Execution: After the stage of making the decision, there are two scenarios. If the proposal is accepted, it will be executed; otherwise, it will be canceled.  In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: the amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time.  Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features:      Democracy: The voting enforcement process is democratic and transparent.     Connectivity: The community members can recommend, discuss, and manage the products and the development direction of the Trava Ecosystem.     Up-to-date: The community members can recommend the latest technologies and features based on the market trend that help the whole system make changes to the protocol for the best result.  The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2  Trava is the first one that allows users to create and manage their own lending pool. In the future, governance will play a significant role in the initialization movements and their operation in the future.  In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process.  Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.']","['Register **Registration Error** × Looks like your connection to Trava Forum was lost, please wait while we try to reconnect.', '1.

Buying veTRAVA  Step 1: Just click on any sale slot:  Step 2: You will be directed to this page, click the “Buy” button:  Step 3: Confirm the money in the transaction and wait for it to be done:', 'What is veTRAVA?  To fulfill the “decentralized” part of the Trava Decentralized Marketplace, we launched Trava Governance, based on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model, to give users decision-making power. In this case, veTRAVA, in the form of NFT, represents this power and is determined by the time and amount of locked tokens (as they show your commitment toward the future of Trava Finance).  With the implementation of the Trava Governance Vault, users can lock their TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB into this vault to receive a certain amount of veTRAVA representing their powers: the more veTRAVA you own, the higher your voting power in the Trava ecosystem. The Benefits Of Owning veTRAVA  The key value of veTRAVA is its representative of users’ power and their commitment to the project. As a result, in the long term, users who own veTRAVA can receive significant benefits:      Deciding on crucial parameters such as LTV, risk parameters, etc., in the lending pools (Trava Lending Pool and Users-owned Pools).     Receiving share profit coming from the fee charged by borrowers     Receiving boosting rewards in rTRAVA by providing liquidity and holding veTRAVA at the same time.     Earning TRAVA reward: the APR will be revealed soon.  As mentioned, veTRAVA is utilized as a form of NFT. For now, it can only be available for those who lock their token into the Governance Vault. However, it will be exchanged peer-to-peer with the launch of veTRAVA Marketplace. veTRAVA Marketplace: Overview  As its name suggests, the veTRAVA marketplace is for users to buy and sell their veTRAVA. It means they can freely exchange their voting power. The main reason we came up with this idea is to optimize users’ experience, bringing them as much freedom as possible. It’s the “Decentralization” we are heading for.  Besides bringing more freedom to users, veTRAVA Marketplace increases liquidity for veTRAVA and thus benefits both sellers and buyers. In more detail, buyers can buy veTRAVA (voting power) easily on Marketplace and then earn voting power immediately. In this case, the remaining locking time will be more flexible, no longer limited to a particular period set in the Governance Vault. When it comes to sellers, they can easily utilize crypto assets in a more liberal way and get benefits from it. The Influences of veTRAVA Marketplace  veTRAVA Marketplace is an important feature that contributes to the development of Trava Governance. As mentioned above, users who hold many veTRAVA will have a crucial role in the decision-making process of the Trava Finance ecosystem. The veTRAVA holders can alternate the voting results, and through the Marketplace, users can buy or sell the voting power with others.  With the fact that users can trade their voting power to each other, anyone in the ecosystem will have a chance to vote for the changes they want to make in Trava Finance. The more users have veTRAVA, the more voting power is distributed, and users will be given the full power to make the decisions that can affect the Decentralized Lending Marketplace, which will elevate the decentralized side of Trava Finance’s ultimate goal.']","['Lock your tokens for veTRAVA: : Lock Calculator Select the token you want to lock, input lock amount, and select unlock time to see how many voting power you will have. : Create new veTRAVA lock 1.

Creating a user-friendly landing page is one of the priorities for better user experience. Additionally, Trava Finance lending product team should start working on adding more tokens to ""Token Health"" so they could be added to pool creation once the product is 100% finished - having more tokens available for pool creation feature is an advantage to attract more userbase and investors. Lastly, I like the (idea 4.) - creating more DeFi investment options to explore in DeFi Cryptospace is great for expanding community knowledge about investment possibilities and also making the BRicher tool more flexible.

Auction Trava NFT Auction is a platform for NFT owners to sell their Knights by creating an Auction room and waiting for bidders to join and buy the Knights. Bidders can join any room and bid on the preferred Knights to become the owners of the Knights. Assembly This is a function for users to combine 4 different kinds of NFT Armoury to create a complete NFT Knight. B: Buy Order Allows users to order Knights, Items they need on our NFT Marketplace. D: Disassemble This function allows users to take apart an NFT Knight to 4 different NFT Armoury. E: EXP EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault. Expeditions This includes missions that Knights can join to earn high rewards in a certain amount of time. The mission's success rate depends on the mission's difficulty, the rarity of the Knights, and their accumulated experience. H: Heuristic Farming This is a farming mechanism based on EXP with 5 new vaults, and you can deposit as many knights as you want into each Vault, provided those knights have the same rarity as that Vault. Rewards from Heuristic Farming are rTRAVA tokens and EXP (one EXP for every 3 seconds in the vault). Higher EXP, higher rewards.

What is health factor and how is it calculated exactly?,0.9011,True,"['What is Health factor?  Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation?  The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals.', 'Health Factor  For a wallet, these risk parameters enable the calculation of the health factor: Hf=C1×LT1+⋯+Cn×LTnB Hf\u200b=BC1\u200b×LT1\u200b+⋯+Cn\u200b×LTn\u200b\u200b  where  BB is total borrows (in dollars), C1,…,CnC1\u200b,…,Cn\u200b is  the values (in dollars) of collateral assets, and LT1,…,LTnLT1\u200b,…,LTn\u200b is their liquidation threshold, respectively. When Hf<1Hf\u200b<1 the loan may be liquidated to maintain solvency.']","[""Introduction: In borrowing, when a borrowers’ health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value, a liquidation process might happen. In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty? : The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated? : In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2. PreviousTesting TravaNextTroubleshooting Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?"", 'Is Borrowing assets more beneficial than Selling? : If you sell your assets, you will lose the possession of this particular asset. It means you would be no longer entitled to the potential upside value gain. Whereas, by borrowing, you can still obtain these potential earnings (working capital) without losing your asset. You can borrow when unexpected expenses happen and leverage your holding assets for other investment opportunities. How to borrow? : In order to borrow, you need to deposit any asset to be used as collateral first (check out the Depositing & Earning FAQ section for more info). After depositing, you simply go to the “Borrow” section and click the “Borrow” button on the asset you want to borrow. Input the amount and approve the transaction. The borrowed amount is based on the available deposits that you used as collateral. What is the maximum amount can I borrow? : The maximum amount you can borrow depends on your deposited value and the available liquidity. Please notice the health factor and liquidation threshold indicators to guarantee your collaterals are in the state of safety. Besides, you can not borrow if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor is too low. What type of asset do I repay my loans? : When repaying a loan, the type of asset that you need to repay is in the same asset you borrowed. For example, if you borrow 1 BNB you will pay back 1 BNB plus interest accrued. Another way to pay back the loan is using your collateral. If you want to pay back the loan based on USD price you can borrow any of the available stable coins as USDC, DAI, USDT, etc. How much interest would I pay for my loans? : When borrowing, the interest rate you need to pay depends on the borrowing rate which is determined from the supply and demand ratio of the asset. Moreover, the interest rate is a variable rate so that it changes constantly. The current borrowing rate of your borrowed assets is shown in the Borrowing section of your dashboard, you can check it any time. What is Health factor? : Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation? : The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals. When do I need to repay the loan? : As long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan. However, the accrued interest of your borrowing will grow day by day, making your health factor decrease. When it reaches the threshold of liquidation, your deposited assets are more likely to fall into liquidation status. How to repay the loan? : In order to pay back the loan you go to the Borrowings section of your dashboard and click on the repay button for the asset you borrowed and want to repay. Select the amount to pay back and approve the transaction.

I want to know the details of TRAVA's audit across all auditor platforms.,0.8695,True,"['Audit completion by Certik Audit Scope  The audit focused on the following considerations:      Testing the smart contracts against both common and uncommon attack vectors.      Assessing the codebase to ensure compliance with current best practices and industry standards.      Ensuring contract logic meets the specifications and intentions of the client.      Cross-referencing contract structure and implementation against similar smart contracts produced by industry leaders.      Thorough line-by-line manual review of the entire codebase by industry experts  Findings:  There are seven issues found in total, including 1 Minor Finding, 2 Informational Findings, and 4 Major Findings.  Firstly, one Minor and Two Informational Issues concern some coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused functions, missing zero addresses checking, and function type. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.  Secondly, all four Major Issues are related to Centralization. The owners of the following contracts below can execute some functions without obtaining the consensus of the community:      FactoryRegistry,      AddressesProviderFactory      PoolUpdateControl      LendingPoolConfigurator   Certik Recommendations for the Centralization Issue:  Certik advised to carefully manage the governance/guardian account’s private key to avoid any potential risks of being hacked. In general, Certik strongly recommended centralized privileges or roles in the protocol to be improved via a decentralized mechanism or via smart-contract-based accounts with enhanced security practices, e.g. Multisignature wallets.  Some feasible solutions recommended by Certik that would also mitigate the potential risk include:      Time-lock with reasonable latency, i.e. 48 hours, for awareness on privileged operations;      Assignment of privileged roles to multi-signature wallets to prevent a single point of failure due to the private key;      Introduction of a DAO/governance/voting module to increase transparency and user involvement.  Trava Solutions for the Centralization Issue  Trava has partially resolved these issues via smart-contract-based accounts. In particular:      Deploy a Multi-Signature wallet in BSC mainnet at the address:   0xdF73aC573Dfd430f4C5558B8CbeD86e86145501B      Set up the owner of the contracts and governance to the multi-signature wallet.  Although these issues are major, our approach can avoid the potential risks of centralization. Moreover, in our roadmap, we will enable DAO Functionalities in Q2–2022. The introduction of the DAO module will completely resolve the centralization issues. This approach will make our community control the process and activity of Trava Finance in the near future.', 'Audit completion by Hacken  This thorough security audit checked and ensured the following imperative points as 2 main Categories (1) Code review (2) Functional.  The audit report contains all found security vulnerabilities and other issues in the reviewed code. As a result of the audit, There are no critical issues in our contracts. Besides, Hacken’s security engineers found 4 high, 4 medium, and 3 low severity issues. Overall, after the auditing process, Hacken evaluated Trava’s contracts as Well-Secured (the highest level of security as the assessment). Severity High  There is one issue regarding the implementation function and three issues regarding uninitialized state variables:      Issue 1 (unimplemented function): The logic of function finalizeTranfer has commented-out unimplemented logic. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.      Issues 2, 3, 4 (uninitialized state variables): Some state variables are not initialized for the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager but they are being called.          Trava’s Response: We consider the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager as a Logic Contract where we execute our code by using delegate call from LendingPool Contract. That explains why we don’t initialize the state for that variable.          Following the verification, Hacken determined that these are not issues.  Severity Medium  There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused imports, Not checked contract address, and No event on lendingPoolConfigurator change. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.  There is one Issue concerning Possible FlashLoan attack in the LendingPool contract. Despite the fact that we do not believe this attack could happen in real life, we took great care in resolving the problem.  Description: IF both of TToken and its underlyingAsset are traded on multiple DEXes and have different rates there could be a FlashLoan attack. Attackers could FlashLoan a TToken, and process withdraw, which will give then the exact same amount of the underlyingAsset, and then calling deposit, they will receive the same amount of TToken.  Having the 1-to-1 “exchange” on the LendingPool and different rates on DEXes, attackers could “play” with the market many times in one transaction until they receive enough rewards. The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.  The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.  Hacken’s Recommendation: Consider some restrictions like minting/returning assets in the next block only.  Trava’s solution: Token transfer restrictions for transferring in the same block where minting occurred.  After the verification, Hacken concluded that the issue had been resolved completely. Severity Low  There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to Unused state variable, public/external function, Unused function argument. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.']","['Register **Registration Error** × Looks like your connection to Trava Forum was lost, please wait while we try to reconnect.', 'The concept of decentralised finance (DeFi) is leading the change in the way we conduct our finances across the globe.

Idea As announced recently, we are preparing to launch the Trava Station. Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. 2. Information Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, Freight is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes Smart Wallet , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the main interface of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don’t have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA.

Explain EXP and how can I use it for Farming,0.998,True,"['At the moment, EXP (Experience Point) is the point that shows how long an Armoury NFT is staked in our vaults. EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault.  Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault  We’ve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items).  You can see your EXP  either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace.  Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs. However, when you withdraw your Knight NFT, disassemble and reassemble with different items to get another Knight NFT, your Armoury NFTs will have different EXPs.  For example: You open 4 chests and get: Helmet, Shield, Armour and Weapon. You assemble them into a Knight NFT and farm in our vault. After 24h, the EXPs for Armoury NFTs are as follow:      Weapon EXP: 86400      Shield EXP: 86400      Armor EXP: 86400      Helmet EXP: 86400  So EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400 (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400  After 24h, you withdraw your Knight NFT to reassemble with Armoury NFTs you buy on Trava NFT Marketplace. Suppose, those Armoury NFTs you bought have been already farmed in vault before and have the EXPs as follow:      Weapon EXP: 86400      Shield EXP: 100000      Armor EXP: 320000      Helmet EXP: 210000  Thus, the EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100 (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100  There will be a lot of benefits for NFT owners to have high EXPs. The more EXP you have, the more value the NFT will be. This can help you to distinguish NFT value from other NFTs of the same type and rarity. Moreover, the EXP will be applied in our Trade-up Mechanism which will be launched soon. In the future, EXP will be used with Credit Score and applied to NFT-collateralization.

EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault. Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault We’ve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items). You can see your EXP either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace. Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs. However, when you withdraw your Knight NFT, disassemble and reassemble with different items to get another Knight NFT, your Armoury NFTs will have different EXPs. For example: You open 4 chests and get: Helmet, Shield, Armour and Weapon. You assemble them into a Knight NFT and farm in our vault. After 24h, the EXPs for Armoury NFTs are as follow: * Weapon EXP: 86400 * Shield EXP: 86400 * Armor EXP: 86400 * Helmet EXP: 86400 So EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400(86400 + 86400 + 86400 + 86400) / 4 = 86400(86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400 After 24h, you withdraw your Knight NFT to reassemble with Armoury NFTs you buy on Trava NFT Marketplace. Suppose, those Armoury NFTs you bought have been already farmed in vault before and have the EXPs as follow: * Weapon EXP: 86400 * Shield EXP: 100000 * Armor EXP: 320000 * Helmet EXP: 210000 Thus, the EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100(86400 + 100000 + 320000 + 210000) / 4 = 179100(86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100 There will be a lot of benefits for NFT owners to have high EXPs. The more EXP you have, the more value the NFT will be. This can help you to distinguish NFT value from other NFTs of the same type and rarity.

For example, multiple Silver Helmets can be traded up to a Gold Helmet. The idea of Trade-Up Mechanism is that NFT owners will be given a great opportunity to take advantage of their unused NFTs and then level up them to the higher rarity. With higher rarity, NFT owners can assemble items into Knight NFTs of higher rarity and farm them for a higher APR, allowing them to gain bigger profits. Moreover, the high rarity of the NFT will bring its owner a huge advantage in Auction mechanism in the future. In the meantime, our Trade-up Mechanism will help us solve the problem of redundancy of idle NFTs as we issue more chests. 4 Armoury NFTs of the same rarity and type will be assembled into a single NFT of higher rarity and the same type. The success rate of trading up will be based on a base rate, and increase with EXP. * Success: A new NFT with higher rarity will be minted and transferred to the wallet of the user. In the meantime, four ingredient Armoury NFTs will be burnt. Furthermore, regardless of how much EXP the four burned NFTs had gained, the EXP of the new NFT will be 0. * Failure: Users will only receive back three out of four ingredient NFTs, with the lowest EXP NFT being burned. In our Trade-up Mechanism, each rarity has a failure rate called _baseFailureRate_ and a failure time threshold called _timeBase_. Moreover, the failure rate will be determined by the total EXP of all Armoury NFTs which are selected to do trade-up, this EXP is referred to as _collectiveEXP_. The EXP of selected Armoury NFTs is inversely proportional to the failure rate, which means that the higher the total EXP of selected NFTs, the lower the failure rate. If all 4 NFT pieces don't have any experience point, the failure rate is equal to the base failure rate. **Trade-up** **Copper → Silver** **Silver → Gold** **Gold → Diamond** **Diamond → Crystal** **Failure Rate** 50% 60% 70% 80% **Time Base** 8 days 20 days 64 days 200 days collectiveEXP=exp(nft1)+exp(nft2)+exp(nft3)+exp(nft4) collectiveEXP = exp(nft1) + exp(nft2) + exp(nft3) + exp(nft4)collectiveEXP=exp(nft1)+exp(nft2)+exp(nft3)+exp(nft4) The formula for failure rate will be calculated as belows: Where, * _RFP: Relative Fail Percent_ * _b: Base Failure Rate_ * _x: Collective Experience of Ingredients_ * _t: Time Base of Rarity_ _If x = 0 then RFP = b_ _If x < t then RFP = b * k, k > 50%_ _If x = t then RFP = b * 0.5_ _If x > t then RFP = b * k, k < 50%_ For example: All 4 NFTs are Diamond Weapons and have different EXP, respectively: * NFT 1: 1000000 EXP * NFT 2: 2000000 EXP * NFT 3: 3500000 EXP * NFT 4: 2500000 EXP => x = 1000000 + 2000000 + 1500000 + 500000 = 9000000 EXP t = 200*24*60*60 = 17280000 Therefore, the failure rate of Trade-Up will decrease to 52.74%, meaning you will have a 47.26% chance of successfully trading up if your collective experience of your ingredient NFTs are like above. Note that, due to the nature of the blockchain development language, the displayed result may vary very slightly around the exact computed value. If you are in the failure rate, your NFT 1 with 1000000 EXP (the lowest EXP) will be burned and you will only receive the rest of your ingredient NFTs (NFT2, NFT3 and NFT4).

Trava Administration 3 Jul 2024, 21:00 * Trava Capital — Renovation & Innovation posted in Others 1. Idea: Starting from TraDAO and turning into Trava Capital, its growth is closely connected to our community. Correspondingly, when technology reaches another high and the market is in a bullish phase with many opportunities awaiting, it’s time for renovation and innovation. Therefore, our team has discussed carefully and had the first thoughts about the updates we can make with Trava Capital. We intend to separate it from Trava Finance into its own being — an AI platform that enables running liquidity provision strategies on blockchains. But no matter which direction we go, our ultimate goal is still to benefit users and the entire Trava ecosystem. Our community is always the center. 2. Information: Trava Capital is an important pillar of our ecosystem, which currently provides users with two main investment models — Treasury and Crowdfunding. It has been and is still bringing benefits to the community, however, our team foresees its even brighter future. Our goal is to build a trustless market-making infrastructure & strategies on DEX V3, as well as Lending pool on multi-chains, with the integration of AI technology. From there, Liquidity providers can utilize our features to have their liquidity managed in an automated, capital-efficient, non-custodial, and transparent manner. We hope to democratize market-making, enabling DEXs and Lending to become the primary trading venue for all assets, even beyond crypto. 3. Ask for Suggestions: During this initial ideation stage, the features we can propose include: * Multiple Concentrated Liquidity Positions * Cross-fee tier Vaults * Inventory Management * Non-Custodial * … and more. So what do you think about this new renovation and innovation plan for Trava Capital? With the new goal of becoming an AI platform that enables running liquidity provision strategies on blockchains as mentioned above, what features do you think we should add?""]","['https://docs.trava.finance/pottery-mechanism', 'https://docs.trava.finance/user-guide/vetrava-marketplace-user-guide', 'https://gov.trava.finance/register', 'https://gov.trava.finance/login', 'https://gov.trava.finance/uid/11']","['https://docs.trava.finance/pottery-mechanism', 'https://blog.trava.finance/trava-finance-in-2023-206167384f14']"
What is backing per TOD?,0.8816,True,"['Backing per TOD   Every TOD in circulation is backed by the TraDAO treasury, composed of stablecoins, TOD-stablecoin LP tokens, and other assets. Backing per TOD is the dollar value of each TOD token based on the backing reserve.']","[""A: APY Annual Percentage Yield is the normalized representation of an interest rate, based on a compounding period over one year. Note that APYs provided are ballpark level indicators and not precise future results. Auto-compound Staking The rewards from the staking program are compounded. The compounding period of approximately 8 hours explains the high APY. B: Backing per TOD Every TOD in circulation is backed by the TraDAO treasury, composed of stablecoins, TOD-stablecoin LP tokens, and other assets. Backing per TOD is the dollar value of each TOD token based on the backing reserve. Backing Reserves Backing Reserves is the sum of all reserve assets' RFV value from the treasury. Bond Installment Installment bonding is one of the regulations of TraDAO, which allow users to pay partly in a certain time when buying bonds; they don’t have to pay all in one go. They can deposit bonds to auto-compound vaults to earn rewards and payout original debt plus corresponding interest debt. C: Circulating Supply The best approximation of the number of TOD tokens circulating in the market and in the general public's hands. Current Index When users stake TOD, they will receive xTOD tokens. The index value represents the conversion ratio between TOD and xTOD. At the initial state of the protocol, the index is 1.0, which means the conversion is 1:1. The index will increase through the rebase process to track how much users’ TOD balance has increased from auto-compounding reward. Index will never decrease, only increase. D: DAO Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a governance mechanism for making decisions in a more trustless and collaborative way. Voting rights are often bound to a governance token. Discount Users have a chance to buy TOD with a discount by purchasing Bonds. When the demand for Bonds gets too high, the bond price might rise above its market price, therefore the discount might have a negative value. M: Market Cap The market cap (or market capitalization) is the total dollar value of TOD tokens in circulation. Market Value of Treasury Assets Market Value of Treasury Assets is the sum of the value (in dollars) of all assets held by the treasury Multi-chain Deployment TraDAO will be deployed on multiple chains in the future, which opens more opportunities for new investors to get more rewards while bonding and staking in our TraDAO system. N: Next Reward Amount The next reward amount is the increasing number of a user’s TOD balance in the next rebase. Next Reward Yield Reward yield is the interest rate for compounding staking. This reward yield depends on the total value staked and the treasury’s balance. It may change each epoch to achieve sustainable reward emission. P: Protocol Owned Liquidity Protocol Owned Liquidity is the amount of LP the treasury owns and controls Purchased Every bond program has a capacity, set at the opening time and can not be changed. Purchased parameter is the percentage of bond sold over its capacity. R: Reward Rate Reward rate is the configured percentage of TOD distributed to all stakers on each rebase relative to the total supply. The reward rate is precisely adjusted based on user benefit and runaway time available by protocol policy. Risk-Free Value (RFV) Risk-Free Value is the amount of funds the treasury guarantees to use for backing TOD. There are two types of assets reserved in the treasury: stablecoins and LP tokens. S: Secondary Bond Marketplace A bond marketplace allows users to auction and purchase liquidated bonds, immature bonds,... It provides users another gateway to bond and takes advantage of liquidated bonds or immature bonds to leverage their profit through Staking Strategy. Staking ROI T: TOD Reputation TOD reputation is a parameter to evaluate holders’ loyalty to the token TOD, expressing the trust and reputation of the holder in the token community. Total Supply TOD is an uncapped token with a dynamic supply depending on market supply-demand. TOD supply increases when minted by Treasury only: 1. TOD is minted and distributed as stakers’ rewards. 2. TOD is minted from bond revenues whenever someone purchases a bond: - TOD is minted for bonders when they redeem after the vesting period and unstake. - TOD is minted for DAO, determined by a rate set by the policy team. Total Value Staked The total value staked is the number of TOD tokens users staked in the staking contract, multiplied by TOD’s price on the market. Treasury The treasury is a basket of assets (e.g., BUSD, DAI, TOD-BUSD LP…) to back the value of TOD. Treasury Balance Complete name is the market value of treasury assets. Treasury balance is defined as the total market value of all registered assets in the treasury. V: Vesting Time After purchasing bonds, TOD tokens will be available for claiming after a vesting period… Users can keep track of their bonds’ vesting time in the My Bond section from UI. While vesting, your TOD tokens are automatically staked. There is two types of vesting terms: * Fixed expiration: vesting time will be the time difference between the time of purchasing until the bond closes. If the bond is vested at 10:00 AM, March 14, any notes purchased can be redeemed after that time. * Fixed term: vesting time will always be a duration set per bond. If the vesting is 7 days, you can redeem it exactly 7 days after buying it.

First on coingecko chart looks dead/ we dont have even info about tod pair on site coingecko. People dont have idea about existing tod atm. No marketing on social media about tod. Second. Also you promised keeping 1usd price of tod. You dont make it cuz we had bearmarket but its time to proof it in bullrun and make tod great again. 1 Reply Last reply * last edited by There are 2 options imo: 50k is ideal, but some attention is needed to get there. Maybe some extra attention or a nice reward in $TOD? 20k possible with some low attention. Under 20k is a pity imo. 1 Reply Last reply * last edited by To make the TRAVA/TOD pair, the liquidity values need to be equalized between the two pairs. My suggestion and TOD is the same TVL as TRAVA, but if it doesn't reach 50k, it's the minimum. We need more incentives for TOD, the market doesn't know it. However, we need the TRAVA token to gain more traction and consequently the market will view TOD positively. 1 Reply Last reply * last edited by Hi, In the case of lacking target TVL, do you have any suggest for this?

What is Token Health and how can it measure a crypto risk?,0.8868,True,"['What is Token Health?  Token Health is an index to evaluate the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava is the world-first lending platform that provides this index by collecting and aggregating various types of data from blockchain networks. The health of each token is evaluated as a specific value in the range of [0; 1000]. This health index gives the users a comprehensive overview of tokens in the cryptocurrency world and thus facilitates TRAVA lending and other DEFI businesses. Original features in Trava Token Health  Standardizing value for each indicator: There have been a few projects providing information on tokens such as Coingecko, CoinMarketCap, LunarCrush, CREAM Finance, DMM Exchange, etc. They typically present multiple types of on-chain data represented by raw numbers only. For example, they show the market capitalization of tokens but do not standardize those values, which makes it harder for users to understand the meaning of the values or make a comparison among different tokens. Performing standardization for the numeric indicators, Trava allows users to quickly assess different tokens in terms of MarketCap, Trading Volume, Token Price, etc.  Aggregate all indicators into a single index: Similar projects simply present multiple token indicators to users without combining them into a single index to make a comprehensive assessment of tokens. Trava Token Health Model, which is a user-oriented model, has been built to address this inconvenience by computing those separate indicators and combining all of them into an insightful index, i.e., Token Health. Users can use this single value to evaluate the health of a token and can quickly decide to invest in the token or not.  Utilizing both absolute and relative indicators: The absolute indicators are commonly used in many token-analyzing projects, while relative values are typically being overlooked. The absolute and separated values do not provide many complete insights, as those values \u200b\u200bare not correlated with each other. Different from other projects, Trava makes use of both absolute and relative indicators to evaluate the Token Health in the most precise and overall manner. Let us take an example with tokens A and B. The trading volume of token A is $100M, while that of token B is $10M. People tend to quickly jump to the conclusion that token A outweighs token B with regards to the trading volume. However, when considering the market cap of the two tokens, it shows that the MarketCap of token A is 1000 times greater than that of token A. Thus, in the correlation with the MarketCap, the trading volume of token B is in fact much more impressive than that of token A. The example shows that, by combining absolute and relative indicators, Trava Model provides more comprehensive insights compared with related projects.  Customized UI for each user: The UI for Trava Token Heath can be customized for individual preference. Trava provides users with the leaderboard of all tokens, ranked by the total score (i.e., Token Health) or other single indicators such as market cap, token price, and trading volume. Users can access the historical charts of each indicator to get more insights. Moreover, what makes Trava Token Health special compared to the related projects is that Trava enables users to customize the charts based on their preferences. For example, they can add their favorite tokens with their preferable indicators in a single chart to compare and evaluate multiple tokens in an easy, time-saving, and elegant manner.  Various types of indicators: The Trava Token Health model is constructed based on various parameters in different aspects of DeFi. There are seven main parameters; all are selected and analyzed under a strict process before being deployed to ensure the most reliability and creditworthiness. In addition to the absolute values, we also calculate and analyze the relative values such as: the price over the highest score or the trading volume over the MarketCap. We also consider the fluctuation of the values over time. The detailed model will be presented in the next section Trava Token Health model  Trava has studied and developed an exclusive token rating model. The model takes into account various types of data. At present, the data is grouped into seven main indicators including (1) Market cap, (2) Number of transactions, (3) Volume of transactions, (4) Number of holders, (5) Distribution of tokens to holders, (6) Price, and (7) Price stability. Each indicator in turn is evaluated based on several sub-parameters. The use of Trava Token Health  One of the significant benefits of Token Health is to reduce risks. When participating in the crypto world, users have to face many types of risks such as token price crashes or collateral liquidation when borrowing. Token Health will be a useful tool for users to minimize these risks. They can determine which tokens should not be invested at certain times to avoid risks. Let us take an example of how two major risks can be addressed by Trava Token Health:      Risk of token liquidity. In the DeFi field, price fluctuations can result in risks of loan liquidation for both the pool owners and liquidity providers. With Trava Token Health, the pool owner can choose stable price tokens to allow performing actions in the pool to avoid this risk.     Risk of token inflation. Tokens with high inflation are more likely to have a price crash. Users in DeFi can suffer significant losses due to such crashes. With Trava Token Health, users have a full overview of token price, using our price stability indicator, the price over the highest score, or the Token Health index. This information is an effective tool for users to avoid the risk of tokens’ price crashes.  Moreover, Trava Token Health assists users to make optimal decisions on token investing. In the past, choosing which tokens to invest, lend or borrow, was a major problem for users in the crypto world because there was no credible basis for them to assess the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava Token Health allows users to observe the history of multiple token indicators and the overall Token Health index to be more confident when making their investment decisions.']","['A: Age of the wallet (day) The period that the wallet has participated in the crypto market since its first transaction.

PreviousBricher GlossaryNextTraDAO Glossary Last updated 2 years ago', 'Is Borrowing assets more beneficial than Selling? : If you sell your assets, you will lose the possession of this particular asset. It means you would be no longer entitled to the potential upside value gain. Whereas, by borrowing, you can still obtain these potential earnings (working capital) without losing your asset. You can borrow when unexpected expenses happen and leverage your holding assets for other investment opportunities. How to borrow? : In order to borrow, you need to deposit any asset to be used as collateral first (check out the Depositing & Earning FAQ section for more info). After depositing, you simply go to the “Borrow” section and click the “Borrow” button on the asset you want to borrow. Input the amount and approve the transaction. The borrowed amount is based on the available deposits that you used as collateral. What is the maximum amount can I borrow? : The maximum amount you can borrow depends on your deposited value and the available liquidity. Please notice the health factor and liquidation threshold indicators to guarantee your collaterals are in the state of safety. Besides, you can not borrow if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor is too low. What type of asset do I repay my loans? : When repaying a loan, the type of asset that you need to repay is in the same asset you borrowed. For example, if you borrow 1 BNB you will pay back 1 BNB plus interest accrued. Another way to pay back the loan is using your collateral. If you want to pay back the loan based on USD price you can borrow any of the available stable coins as USDC, DAI, USDT, etc. How much interest would I pay for my loans? : When borrowing, the interest rate you need to pay depends on the borrowing rate which is determined from the supply and demand ratio of the asset. Moreover, the interest rate is a variable rate so that it changes constantly. The current borrowing rate of your borrowed assets is shown in the Borrowing section of your dashboard, you can check it any time. What is Health factor? : Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation? : The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals. When do I need to repay the loan? : As long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan. However, the accrued interest of your borrowing will grow day by day, making your health factor decrease. When it reaches the threshold of liquidation, your deposited assets are more likely to fall into liquidation status. How to repay the loan? : In order to pay back the loan you go to the Borrowings section of your dashboard and click on the repay button for the asset you borrowed and want to repay. Select the amount to pay back and approve the transaction. PreviousStaking/Depositing & EarningNextTesting Trava Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?', 'In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. TRAVA.FINANCE uses credit scores to ensure the safety of the lending process. Pool owners and lenders can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. Based on the credit scores, they can determine the maximum Loan-To-Value ratio for borrowers. Borrowers with high credit scores get preferential treatment; they can borrow cryptos with more favorable interest rates and Loan-To-Value ratios. Credit scores provide an incentive for users to (i) hold their wallet addresses as long as possible and keep them clean, (ii) perform the cross-chain identification protocol to interlink their addresses, (iii) perform more transactions inside and outside TRAVA.FINANCE, and so on. This increases crypto liquidity and fosters the growth of the DeFi system. The credit score evaluation in TRAVA.FINANCE is primarily based on on-chain data. At present, we collect, enrich, and analyze Binance Smart Chain transactions, including the native transferring transactions and the transactions to deposit, withdraw, repay, and borrow tokens generated from Binance Smart Chain lending DApps. TRAVA.FINANCE evaluates credit scores for both wallet addresses and other digital assets. Wallet addresses operated for a long time with good transaction history (e.g., an address that has transactions with many other addresses, always pays debts on time, and performs transactions frequently) will have a high credit score. Pool owners can use credit scores as a criterion to select competent wallet addresses for their pool’s liquidity providers. The credit rating of digital assets helps pool owners and liquid providers to minimize liquidity risk. TRAVA.FINANCE divides digital assets into two categories: Tokens/coins and other digital assets (e.g., NFT, smart contracts, stoke tokens) and evaluates their credit scores. The credit score of a **Token** is assessed based on 4 parameters, i.e., (i) the token price, (ii) the market cap (MC) of the token, (iii) the token trading volume, and (iv) the number of transactions related to the token. High-credit-score tokens have a great advantage over low-credit-score tokens. Once being used as collaterals, they offer high loan-to-value ratios to borrowers; lenders also get favorable lending interest rates with their high-credit-score tokens. Users can improve their credit scores once they possess those high-valuable digital assets. TRAVA.FINANCE also performs credit ratings for other **digital assets such as NFT**. The credit scores for NFTs are estimated based on the number of times that they have been auctioned on TRAVA.FINANCE or other trusted platforms. NFTs’ scores should not depend on their price because their price is typically determined in an unreliable manner, based on the emotion and the preference of customers. To evaluate credit scores for a wallet address, TRAVA.FINANCE credit scoring model will take into account the following factors: * _Total asset_. The total asset represents the financial strength of the wallet address; it is the most intuitive and easiest-to-evaluate parameter. It is also the second most important parameter that affects credit scores. The total asset is the sum of balance and total investment minus total liabilities. The credit score of the address is proportional to its total asset. As this parameter is a volatility index, the credit score is calculated based on both the _average total asset_ in a certain period and the _total current asset_. * _Transaction history_. Transaction history is the most important parameter; it has a major impact on credit scores. TRAVA.FINANCE collects and aggregates all exchanges, loans, deposits, and other transactions of the wallet address across multiple DApps to calculate various intermediate parameters such as (i) the age of the address, (ii) its transaction amount, (iii) its frequency of transaction, (iv) its number of liquidations and (v) its total value of liquidations. * _Loan ratios_. Loan ratios (debt ratios) represent the debt position of the account. It is divided into two sub-parameters, i.e., loan-to-balance ratio and loan-to-investment ratio. * _Circulating assets_. This parameter represents how active users are in the crypto market. The more money they invest in the crypto market, the more creditworthiness they gain from others. This parameter is evaluated based on 2 sub-parameters, (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE (Return on equity). * _Trustworthiness of possessing assets_. The last parameter for credit rating is the trustworthiness of the assets owned by the wallet address. The wallet can improve its credit score by possessing high-value and trustworthy digital assets. At present, TRAVA.FINANCE evaluates two types of digital assets only (i.e, Token and NFT). PreviousCross-chain IdentificationNextCollateralized NFTs Last updated 3 years ago Was this helpful?', ""Introduction: In borrowing, when a borrowers’ health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value, a liquidation process might happen. In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty? : The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated? : In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2.

What is users’ credit score? : In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner. What benefits does credit score brings to users? : -For borrowers, the primary benefit is that they can borrow with a ""preferential interest rate"" if their credit score is high. They can also receive higher loan-to-value-ratio compared to other users For lenders, who have high credit scores easily become LPs of different pools. Moreover, when they create a pool, their pool will have a higher credit score because the pool creator\'s credit score is also a criterion for the pool scoring. Especially, pool owners can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. How Credit scores for wallet addresses are calculated? : To evaluate credit scores for wallet addresses, TRAVA credit scoring model will take into account 5 factors: 1. Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address. 2. Transaction history: TRAVA aggregates all transactions of a wallet address across all platforms to calculate various parameters such as (i) transaction amount, (ii) number of liquidations, etc. 3. Loans ratio: represents the debt position of an account, including the Loan-to-balance ratio and Loan-to-investment ratio. 4. Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. 5. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range. The z-score is calculated from the mean and the standard deviation from every corresponding parameter of all accounts. To be more specific, you can read this function in TRAVA whitepaper. How the user\'s credit score will be updated? : Our system has both periodic updates and instant updates. The instant update occurs when users actively make transactions such as deposit, withdraw, repay... Or when users view their credit score on our app. In case a user has not viewed their credit score and had no transactions for a long time, their credit score is still updated periodically and automatically, which can be weekly or monthly. We are still trying to optimize it. Which objects does Trava evaluate credit score for? : At the moment, Trava has been evaluating the credit scores for 3 types of Objects: Wallet addresses (users), tokens, and NFTs. How to increase my credit score? : To improve the credit score of your wallet, you would need to take into account our five parameters, i.e., Total asset, Transaction history, Loans ratios, Circulating assets, and Trustworthiness of possessing assets. For instance, you should increase your wallet balance with prestige coins and tokens, perform more transactions and become more active in the crypto market, maintaining good Loan-to-balance and Loan-to-investment ratios, supply more liquidity to lending pools, trade on lending DApps to earn as much profit as you can, avoid collateral liquidation while borrowing, and possess at least $1000 valuable token (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, or BNB). Besides, you need to be credible users for a long time. It is because to avoid fraud, TRAVA calculates some credit score parameters based on their average values in the last k days, where k depends on the volatility of the crypto market. Moreover, some parameters are assessed based on the “standardized score” function, which calculates the mean and the standard deviation of all accounts’ parameters. Thus, trying to be the best at some criteria would improve your credit score too. Why did my credit score decrease? : The reasons why your credit score drops might be: You have bad transactions such as borrowing liquidations, your balance decrease, your borrowing rate is higher, you are not active enough, etc...You can read our white paper to understand how the credit score mechanism functions. https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/credit-score-evaluation PreviousTroubleshootingNextNFTs Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?']","['https://docs.trava.finance/glossary/analytics-glossary', 'https://docs.trava.finance/faq/borrowing', 'https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/credit-score-evaluation', 'https://docs.trava.finance/faq/liquidations', 'https://docs.trava.finance/faq/trava-credit-score']",['https://blog.trava.finance/introducing-alpha-version-of-trava-token-health-57afe1fa3456']

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

Idea At the bear market, Trava Team focuses on building more features and products to expand the Trava Ecosystem. For example, to better manage Trava Lending Pool, Trava Finance has launched Governance. However, we\'d also love to hear more from Trava Knights, and see the different perspectives on the flow of ideas.

Explain TRADAO and its public offering.,0.8843,True,"['What is TRADAO?  TRADAO is the world’s first protocol supporting multi-chain deployment in DeFi 2.0, and also Web 3.0 compatible. TraDAO is protocol owned liquidity (POL), accumulating value through such activities of bonding and auto-compound staking which are regulated by Trava Treasury. As a product in Trava ecosystem, the liquidity owned by TRADAO protocol could be deposited in Trava Lending Pool to generate more profit and this profit will be shared among users in the entire Trava ecosystem.  TRADAO Protocol will issue a decentralized reserve currency — called TOD. The concept behind TOD token is that it is backed by a basket of assets in Trava Treasury that ensures it does not fall below its base value of $1. The TOD token will be released based on the “Mint & Burn” mechanism, managed by no one other than TRADAO protocol. Why is TRADAO different compared to other OHM forks?  In comparison to other initiatives in the DeFi 2.0 space, TRADAO Protocol offers a number of unique advantages to users. How does it work?  Our Bonding allows users to buy TOD at a discounted price compared with exchanges in other assets such as stablecoins, LP tokens, and so on. The number of TOD tokens that the bonder is entitled to will be vested in a certain term.  Bond Installment is a one-of-a-kind feature that allows users to buy more TOD with a little initial amount of assets, then leverage benefits in Staking Strategy, and pay off the debt. Your bond shall be automatically staked after you use Bond Installment.  Wallet Reputation will be integrated with this product in the form of a reference to decide which user will have more benefits (i.e, lower prepaid rate, lower interest fee rate, higher liquidation discount rate,…). For example, holding assets in the Trava Ecosystem can be considered as a condition to gain a high wallet reputation.  Our Staking allows bonders to stake their TOD token in our auto-compounding vault and earn rebase rewards, after receiving TOD tokens from bond sales. The rebase rewards are also from bond sales held in Trava treasury, or profit of the protocol.', 'We are opening two public offering rounds to give our loyal users as well as our new investors more opportunities to take part in the TraDAO Protocol at the very first stage. In both rounds, participants will buy $TOD tokens in BUSD. The details of two rounds are as the table below:  To get off to a good start, Trava will contribute to TraDAO Protocol with $50,000 worth of 20,000 $TOD tokens. This support is to ensure initial liquidity of $TOD and show the commitment of Trava team in developing TraDAO protocol, thus bringing trust to our community and staying the true ideology of Trava since the beginning, that is a fair launch project and independent of any whale or VCs. The funds from sale will be used to back the $TOD sold and provide initial liquidity after listing.  If we are 100% subscribed, the sale will bring in $345,000. $105,000 will be deposited to the treasury to back initial supply. The remaining $240,000 will be added as liquidity. The LP will open on PancakeSwap with 240,000 BUSD and 20,000 $TOD, in addition to 85,000 $TOD from Public Offering and contribution of Trava Team. This means the starting price of $TOD is $12, and total initial liquidity on Pancakeswap is $480,000 of both tokens. Thus, the total Initial Supply of $TOD will be 105,000 $TOD. How can I join Public Offering?  We will also open two (02) Rounds of Whitelist, which will then be merged to one Final Whitelist at the end. The two rounds open to welcome new Knights and incentives for Loyal Knights in the TRAVA ecosystem as follows:      Whitelist Round 1 (will be live on Jan 21st) — Power up TRADAO — To welcome new members into TRAVA Ecosystem     Whitelist Round 2 (will be live on Jan 28th) — Cheer up Trava Knights — To honor TRAVA loyal users  Participants in the Final Whitelist will have a lucky ticket in buying $TOD Token at the cheapest price before it hits the official launch on PancakeSwap. When you buy, you are removed from the whitelist; if some people buy less than their share, everyone who has not yet bought will get a higher allocation. The details of each Round will be released in our next announcements.  After the public offering rounds, we plan to open two strategies of Bonding and Staking for users to leverage their rewards and earn profit from them. We also have a plan to allow Bond Installment and Wallet Reputation for Bond purchases, which creates a perfect gateway for users with small funds to invest and profit from the protocol.']","['Register **Registration Error** × Looks like your connection to Trava Forum was lost, please wait while we try to reconnect.', 'TRAVA.FINANCE: in TRAVA.FINANCE: VISION OF TOD: THE FUTURE OF TRAVA CAPITAL: This article introduces Trava Finance’s vision for TOD tokens, as well as our plans for Trava Capital in the bull trend of the market. : Mar 15, 2024 Mar 15, 2024 [AMA RECAP] LIQUIDITY AND AI ORIENTATION: On March 6, Trava Finance organized an AMA with the CEOs to talk about TRAVA/TOD Listing plan & TravaGPT — our ecosystem’s AI chatbot. : Mar 11, 2024 Mar 11, 2024 Trava Capital — The Investing Model: We are now at the very first steps of rebranding TraDAO to Trava Capital, which is expected to bring users profits from various…: Oct 25, 2022 Oct 25, 2022 TRAVA CAPITAL — TREASURY INVESTING MODEL: Given the community’s decision through the snapshot on September 30, 2022, we have rebranded TraDAO to Trava Capital.

Connect with TRAVA.FINANCE Editors:', ""A: APY Annual Percentage Yield is the normalized representation of an interest rate, based on a compounding period over one year. Note that APYs provided are ballpark level indicators and not precise future results. Auto-compound Staking The rewards from the staking program are compounded. The compounding period of approximately 8 hours explains the high APY. B: Backing per TOD Every TOD in circulation is backed by the TraDAO treasury, composed of stablecoins, TOD-stablecoin LP tokens, and other assets. Backing per TOD is the dollar value of each TOD token based on the backing reserve. Backing Reserves Backing Reserves is the sum of all reserve assets' RFV value from the treasury. Bond Installment Installment bonding is one of the regulations of TraDAO, which allow users to pay partly in a certain time when buying bonds; they don’t have to pay all in one go. They can deposit bonds to auto-compound vaults to earn rewards and payout original debt plus corresponding interest debt. C: Circulating Supply The best approximation of the number of TOD tokens circulating in the market and in the general public's hands. Current Index When users stake TOD, they will receive xTOD tokens. The index value represents the conversion ratio between TOD and xTOD. At the initial state of the protocol, the index is 1.0, which means the conversion is 1:1. The index will increase through the rebase process to track how much users’ TOD balance has increased from auto-compounding reward. Index will never decrease, only increase. D: DAO Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a governance mechanism for making decisions in a more trustless and collaborative way. Voting rights are often bound to a governance token. Discount Users have a chance to buy TOD with a discount by purchasing Bonds. When the demand for Bonds gets too high, the bond price might rise above its market price, therefore the discount might have a negative value. M: Market Cap The market cap (or market capitalization) is the total dollar value of TOD tokens in circulation. Market Value of Treasury Assets Market Value of Treasury Assets is the sum of the value (in dollars) of all assets held by the treasury Multi-chain Deployment TraDAO will be deployed on multiple chains in the future, which opens more opportunities for new investors to get more rewards while bonding and staking in our TraDAO system. N: Next Reward Amount The next reward amount is the increasing number of a user’s TOD balance in the next rebase. Next Reward Yield Reward yield is the interest rate for compounding staking. This reward yield depends on the total value staked and the treasury’s balance. It may change each epoch to achieve sustainable reward emission. P: Protocol Owned Liquidity Protocol Owned Liquidity is the amount of LP the treasury owns and controls Purchased Every bond program has a capacity, set at the opening time and can not be changed. Purchased parameter is the percentage of bond sold over its capacity. R: Reward Rate Reward rate is the configured percentage of TOD distributed to all stakers on each rebase relative to the total supply. The reward rate is precisely adjusted based on user benefit and runaway time available by protocol policy. Risk-Free Value (RFV) Risk-Free Value is the amount of funds the treasury guarantees to use for backing TOD. There are two types of assets reserved in the treasury: stablecoins and LP tokens. S: Secondary Bond Marketplace A bond marketplace allows users to auction and purchase liquidated bonds, immature bonds,... It provides users another gateway to bond and takes advantage of liquidated bonds or immature bonds to leverage their profit through Staking Strategy. Staking ROI T: TOD Reputation TOD reputation is a parameter to evaluate holders’ loyalty to the token TOD, expressing the trust and reputation of the holder in the token community. Total Supply TOD is an uncapped token with a dynamic supply depending on market supply-demand. TOD supply increases when minted by Treasury only: 1. TOD is minted and distributed as stakers’ rewards. 2. TOD is minted from bond revenues whenever someone purchases a bond: - TOD is minted for bonders when they redeem after the vesting period and unstake. - TOD is minted for DAO, determined by a rate set by the policy team. Total Value Staked The total value staked is the number of TOD tokens users staked in the staking contract, multiplied by TOD’s price on the market. Treasury The treasury is a basket of assets (e.g., BUSD, DAI, TOD-BUSD LP…) to back the value of TOD. Treasury Balance Complete name is the market value of treasury assets. Treasury balance is defined as the total market value of all registered assets in the treasury. V: Vesting Time After purchasing bonds, TOD tokens will be available for claiming after a vesting period… Users can keep track of their bonds’ vesting time in the My Bond section from UI. While vesting, your TOD tokens are automatically staked. There is two types of vesting terms: * Fixed expiration: vesting time will be the time difference between the time of purchasing until the bond closes. If the bond is vested at 10:00 AM, March 14, any notes purchased can be redeemed after that time. * Fixed term: vesting time will always be a duration set per bond. If the vesting is 7 days, you can redeem it exactly 7 days after buying it.
