In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty?: The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated?: In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2.

In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty?: The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated?: In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount.

This APY depends on the deposit/borrowing demand in the pool. Borrow: When users want to use a type of asset (which they do not possess in their wallet) to do business without selling their holding assets, they can deposit these available assets as collateral to borrow favorable assets. By this way, they can still do business on any assets they want without losing their holding assets. Withdraw: After depositing, users can withdraw their cryptocurrencies anytime they want. However, as the deposit’s interest accrues over time, so the longer the deposit period, the bigger the interest they will earn. Repay: When borrowing, users can pay back all or part of their loans. Users should adequately manage their repaying to avoid being liquidated collateral.']","['Followers: 245 Followers: Trava Finance is a cross-chain lending marketplace which offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.

How Credit scores for wallet addresses are calculated?,0.9845,True,"['To evaluate credit scores for wallet addresses, TRAVA credit scoring model will take into account 5 factors: Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address.

Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range.

The credit rating of digital assets helps pool owners and liquid providers to minimize liquidity risk. TRAVA.FINANCE divides digital assets into two categories: Tokens/coins and other digital assets (e.g., NFT, smart contracts, stoke tokens) and evaluates their credit scores. The credit score of a Token is assessed based on 4 parameters, i.e., (i) the token price, (ii) the market cap (MC) of the token, (iii) the token trading volume, and (iv) the number of transactions related to the token. High-credit-score tokens have a great advantage over low-credit-score tokens.

We are still trying to optimize it. ', 'To evaluate credit scores for a wallet address, TRAVA.FINANCE credit scoring model will take into account the following factors: Total asset. The total asset represents the financial strength of the wallet address; it is the most intuitive and easiest-to-evaluate parameter. It is also the second most important parameter that affects credit scores. The total asset is the sum of balance and total investment minus total liabilities. The credit score of the address is proportional to its total asset. As this parameter is a volatility index, the credit score is calculated based on both the average total asset in a certain period and the total current asset. Transaction history. Transaction history is the most important parameter; it has a major impact on credit scores. TRAVA.FINANCE collects and aggregates all exchanges, loans, deposits, and other transactions of the wallet address across multiple DApps to calculate various intermediate parameters such as (i) the age of the address, (ii) its transaction amount, (iii) its frequency of transaction, (iv) its number of liquidations and (v) its total value of liquidations. Loan ratios. Loan ratios (debt ratios) represent the debt position of the account. It is divided into two sub-parameters, i.e., loan-to-balance ratio and loan-to-investment ratio. Circulating assets. This parameter represents how active users are in the crypto market. The more money they invest in the crypto market, the more creditworthiness they gain from others. This parameter is evaluated based on 2 sub-parameters, (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE (Return on equity). Trustworthiness of possessing assets. The last parameter for credit rating is the trustworthiness of the assets owned by the wallet address. The wallet can improve its credit score by possessing high-value and trustworthy digital assets.

Once the countdown ends, the auction item will be obtained by the last/highest bidder; The most important rule: 2.5% of the price increase for each bid is distributed to the previous bidder, and the remaining 97.5% would be the income of the auction publisher if it’s the last bid or returned to the bidder when it’s outbid. With the rules, each bidder would either take the 5% share of the next bid or obtain the auction Knight with the price he/she offered. And the first bidder will additionally be free from distributing his/her own 5% to other people. Note: The percentage that the later bidder pays for the earlier bidder is the same as the percentage that the sellers need to pay for the platform. So, 2.5% is also the amount auction publishers pay to the marketplace, which means that after receiving 97.5% of the final bidding price as income, sellers need to pay 2.5% of the income to the NFT marketplace. Therefore, the final payment rate that the sellers receive is 95.06% of the final bid. This fee is utilized for marketing, operating, and functioning.

Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price.

What are benefit for those who participate in the Trava Knight auction?,0.9047,True,"['Benefit for those who participate in the Trava Knight auction Benefit for auction publishers (the sellers) Auction publishers (or sellers) are those who open auctions for their Knights. Opening an auction allows auction publishers to set up their price floor for their Knights, which determines their minimum desired price, helping them avoid selling their Knights at an unwanted low price compared to the market price. The auction opens a great opportunity for Knight owners to make profits without the need of disassembling their Knights to pieces and selling each item multiple times, which can cause wasted gas fees due to multiple transactions. Benefit for bidders Trava Knight auction is of benefit for bidders since it offers them the opportunity to get the full Knight, not every piece of armoury NFT on Trava NFT Marketplace. This helps bidders save more time in obtaining a Knight without finding and collecting armoury items to assemble. The auction also offers bidders an excellent method to get their favorable Knights, which suits their needs for missions such as Farming, Expedition, Farming with EXP and PvP tournaments in the future. Benefit for Trava Lending Pool The NFT Auction is the first step toward Trava Finance’s long-term aim of allowing NFTs to be used as collateral in the Trava Lending pool. By using an auction mechanism, the NFT will be priced and subsequently used as collateral in the Trava loan pool. This is a good method to vary the collaterals and give users more opportunities to lend assets.  ', 'Benefits of Knight NFTs Each of Knight and Armory NFTs represents a unique digital collectible that can be bought, sold, rented and put on auction on Trava Knight NFT Marketplace. It helps increase the utility of not only NFTs for NFT-collateralization, but also $TRAVA in our system as all the trading on the Marketplace is in $TRAVA. Users can assemble Knight NFTs to join Trava Farming Programs (NFT Farming, Heuristic Farming) in different vaults for a great APY — the rarer the NFT, the higher APY. The longer staked in the vaults, Loyal Knight NFT holders will also have more benefits in our lending pool in the future. In addition, you can get rewards from Trava Knight NFTs by playing the Battle Hand Mini-Game, and joining in Missions such as Expedition or Treasure Map.  ', 'TRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below. NFT owners can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it. TRAVA.FINANCE thus increases the liquidity of NFTs and opens up a unique and exciting NFTFi marketplace. Based on the given number of auction bids, bidders have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session. This rewarding mechanism provides incentives for users to actively make a bid in the auction. Auction winners can get their desired NFT at a price lower than their bidding price (once NFT owners cannot repay the loan) or they can receive considerable interest from their loan to NFT owners (once NFT owners repay the loans and get their NFT back). The credit scores of NFT owners, auction winners, bidders, and NFTs can be improved after auctions. The auction mechanism for NFT can also be applied to any type of digital asset. In our road map, TRAVA.FINANCE will implement this auction feature for various types of digital assets (e.g., stock token, smart contract).

So, for members who still have NFTs V1 and don’t know what to do with them, this V Trade-up Mechanism will help you to stay in the “battle.” Introduction: The Trade-Up Mechanism allows NFT owners to combine multiple identical Armoury NFTs V1 of the same rarity into an Armoury NFT V2. For example, multiple Silver Helmets V1 can be traded up to a Silver Helmet V2. The Trade-Up Mechanism aims to provide Trava Armoury NFT owners with a valuable opportunity to utilize their unused NFTs V1 for greater profits. By combining Armoury V2 items, users can create Knight NFTs V2 and join in the upcoming Dilution Staking feature.', ""How to join: To take part in the Treasure Map mission, residents of Trava Kingdom must own a Knight in any rarity. The unique feature of this mission is that even Limited Knight can join. Not only can Limited Knights join, but also they can have priority in the opportunity of getting more Tickets as rewards after finishing the Treasure Map mission. Moreover, as an entrance fee, Knights must have 1 Ticket of any kind to join the Treasure Map mission. But don't worry! The rewards that you receive are worth every cost. Note: Users also have to pay a very small amount as a transaction fee. In conclusion, there are two important things that users MUST HAVE to enter Treasure Map Mission: + 1 Knight (Copper, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Crystal, and Limited Knight) + 1 Ticket (Counter Ticket, Presale Ticket, and Incentive Ticket) NOTE: You can deploy as many Knights as you want in the mission at the same time. ONE Knight requires ONE Ticket to enter. A mission will last for 6 HOURS. *"", 'Trava Knight NFT: In Trava Knight NFT, Trava Ticket can be used in Missions, including Treasure Map and Expedition, as well as an asset to exchange for Chest and receive Armoury to assemble Knights. In the upcoming feature of Trava Knight NFT, the Treasure Map, Ticket will be utilized as an entrance ticket. Players must have a Ticket to enter the missions in Treasure Map. By joining Treasure Map, users can have the opportunity of earning more Tickets and other rewards. Moreover, Ticket will boost the success rate in the Expedition feature. When a user has a Ticket, their success rate after finishing a mission in Expedition is much higher. To enter Expedition, users have to pay a small entrance fee, but the rewards are very worthy, especially now with the enhancement of owning a Ticket. Lastly, the essential utility of Ticket is the capability of exchanging Ticket for Chest and receiving Armoury to build a full Trava Knight. With this utility, users will have chances to enter the Trava Kingdom without paying a large amount of money to buy Knights directly from the Marketplace. Furthermore, with the assembled Knights, users can join in Mission features in Trava Knight NFT, including Farming to gain rewards and EXP, joining Expedition and earn rewards, Incentive Tickets, EXP, etc. In the future, Tickets will be implemented in the PvP Tournament in Trava Knight NFT.

We will recalculate and update the price based on the price on the market, the initial price and the data analysis extracted from our NFT Marketplace. Note that with each wallet, the maximum number of Trava Knight NFT that can be deposited in one vault is one Knight NFT. For example, if you have two Trava Knight NFTs of Gold, for example, you can only stake one of them into Gold Vault to farm and earn $TRAVA rewards. With Copper, Silver and Gold Vault, if NFT owners withdraw their NFTs within 7 days, the farming rewards will decrease by 10%. Knights with a higher rarity can be deposited in vaults of a lower rarity. Continuing the example above, one of your Gold Knights can be deposited in Gold vault and the other can be deposited in either Copper vault or Silver vault and earn APR corresponding to those vaults. Furthermore, for Knight NFTs put in Farming vaults, we shall use the ""Polish Mechanism”. After depositing Knight NFTs in those vaults, users must check their Knights on a regular basis through the Farming site, which is considered a polishing action. If users never check their Knights, the Glossiness of their Knights will deteriorate, and the Farming rewards will drop.

For example, when you create an action with Freight in Trava Station to sell Armoury items, the money won’t immediately go into your Smart Wallet. The NFT will stay there until someone buys it on the Marketplace, at which point the process ends and now your Smart Wallet will hold the money from that sale. Trava Station’s Smart Wallet allows users to create their own routes to execute actions within and between Trava Finance protocols efficiently, particularly with Freight. In addition, there are pre-made routes that you can import from Tramlines to freely use. Smart Wallet also supports storing pre-set rules for specific conditions, which best shows in Junction. This feature includes sequences that won’t run right when you create them, but will be triggered by the system bot when a condition is reached. You can also track all the assets in your Smart Wallet in the Portfolio section of Trava Station. This feature will display your position in the Lending Pool when you use Smart Wallet to perform actions in the pools in the Trava ecosystem. Or as with the example mentioned above — you create an order to sell Armoury items, Portfolio will display those NFTs for sale, and the amount of money you have in your Smart Wallet. Pervasive Benefits of Smart Wallets Smart Wallet is absolutely necessary for Trava Station to work. It provides a smoother DeFi experience by allowing users to combine several transactions into one, minimizing the fee of performing multiple actions at the same time, and so on. Smart Wallet brings more convenient experience while still offering enhanced security, satisfying not only new users but also experienced ones. Thanks to the versatility of smart contracts, it can break user reliance on private keys, offer advantageous new features and provide a better experience. In their development, Smart Wallets also presented a number of other uses, such as allowing multisig transactions, or extra layer of security through authenticating apps. They are also capable of limiting daily transaction amounts, reducing the possibility of costly errors and stopping attackers from emptying your wallet. These are all potential benefits of Smart Wallet that can be applied to Trava Station, which have been looked into and / or currently being developed by the Trava team. Conclusion Smart Wallet marks a pivotal juncture in our journey, offering heightened security and streamlined accessibility for Trava Station. We stand poised to significantly enhance your DeFi experience, formulating an effective ecosystem amidst this evolving landscape. With the release of this product, Trava Finance looks forward to bringing you the most convenience, minimizing costs and time for users’ transactions. 🌟So let’s countdown to Trava Station launch on August 24, 2023 . About Trava.Finance Trava Finance is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, Trava Finance offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.

']","[""Does Trava apply NFTs in the ecosystem?: Yes, TRAVA allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract. How does Trava price NFTs?: Trava will provide the auction function for NFT assets. Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way. We also avoid the price fluctuation of NFT because the NFTs have been priced in the auction contract before."", 'Our vision and mission: NFT-collateralization is considered as one of our USPs. As a result, Trava Finance is making progress toward its goal of allowing NFTs to be used as collateral and improving the lending protocol. In the future, we will develop the auction mechanism to price our NFTs and then prepare to integrate NFTs into our lending pool, which acts as collateral for loans. Trava NFT Marketplace, which is planned to launch first, will be the first step on our path to enable NFT-collateralization feature and bring huge benefits to our lenders and borrowers in the near future. The launch of Trava Knight NFT also helps us to increase TRAVA utility in our system, as all the trading on our Marketplace will be in $TRAVA.

What are the features of Trava Finance?,0.9166,True,"['There are six salient features of TRAVA.FINANCE, including: Crypto lending marketplace: TRAVA.FINANCE creates a marketplace in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and obtain greater earnings. Semantic knowledge graph: TRAVA.FINANCE is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA.FINANCE to efficiently search for useful information such as (i) the amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses; (ii) the provenance of an NFT; (iii) aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc. Data analysis: To reduce lending risks, TRAVA.FINANCE performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA.FINANCE recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, Loan to Value ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA.FINANCE also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools. Credit score evaluation: Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can (i) reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool; and (ii) stimulate borrowing by defining a high Loan to Value ratio for borrowers with high credit scores. Cross-chain identification and cross-chain lending: TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross- chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores. NFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals: To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA.FINANCE allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn considerable amounts from the contract.

How does TRAVA.FINANCE incentivize validators to update the knowledge graph?,0.8571,True,"['Validators must update the knowledge graph regularly, otherwise, they will be stripped of their validator role, and cannot earn rewards for appending new blocks or verifying transactions.” “Each time enriching the knowledge graph, validators will gain the fame score, thereby gaining more priorities and indirectly having the opportunity to earn more TRAVA.FINANCE coins when joining the network.” “Priorities may include voting power or the privilege to unlock TRAVA.FINANCE tokens earlier than the standard time when receiving awards. ']","['Figure 4: Cross-chain identification: The cross-chain identification protocol plays an important role in the TRAVA.FINANCE architecture. It can be used to verify that multiple addresses on different chains belong to the same user. The protocol allows TRAVA.FINANCE to provide an overview of anonymous users, including their total cryptos and other digital assets, statistics for their transactions, and their relationships with other blockchain addresses. These types of information and relationships are stored on the cross-chain knowledge graph. The protocol can (i) improve the credit score of the users and their wallet address so that they can get favorable interest rates, (ii) save them transaction fees since they can use up all of their cryptos as collateral in a single transaction, and (iii) allow them to get their cryptos back when they lose one of their wallet address. To implement the protocol, we develop a wallet application so that users can manage their accounts and prove their ownership of multiple accounts. The application provides users with two functionalities: “Add account” and “Create a proof of ownership”. Users can add a new account to the wallet application in multiple ways, e.g., (i) create an account, (ii) import a private key, and (iii) connect to a hardware wallet. To foster their DeFi transactions, they might need to prove that they are the owner of n addresses. To this end, they can use our wallet application to perform a transaction that activates the cross-chain identification protocol. Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators check the accuracy of the data associated with the transaction. If the data is valid, the validators accept the transaction and write the sameAs relationship among the owners of the addresses to the knowledge graph. In the following we describe our processing to verify the cross-chain identification of multiple wallet addresses.', ""What are the TRAVA token and its utility?: We issue TRAVA tokens based on Binance smart chain's BEP-20 standard; the total supply is 5 billion. These TRAVA tokens can be used in: * Reward: Pool owners can set up rewards paid by TRAVA token. Thus, lending pool depositors will earn rewards by TRAVA token. * Collateral and lending: Users can use TRAVA as mortgages. The users also loan TRAVA. * Payment for lending fees: Users can pay pool lending fees by TRAVA. * Payment for pool management: Pool owners can pay for the pool creation, update (e.g., pool parameters, add/remove tokens, …), and pause by TRAVA. * Payment for auction deposits: in the NFTs auction process, TRAVA can be used as a locked asset. * Payment for auction organization: To perform all auction actions for NFT, the NFT’s owners (auction organizers) can pay the auction fees by TRAVA. * Staking for a data validator: To store credit data stored on the knowledge graph chain, the data must be confirmed by validators. The process is built up to eliminate redundant, unnecessary, and insecure data. The knowledge graph data validators stake by TRAVA. * Staking to participate in the governance process: TRAVA.FINANCE will become a community solution, thus the TRAVA.FINANCE’s rules are elected by participants, who hold TRAVA’s token."", 'Validator side: Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators verify the timestamp and then verify the signatures as follows. They first extract the message {data1, … datan} and the list of signatures {s1, … sn} . From each data element datai , the validators get the chainId and the public key (i.e., pubi ). They use the Merkle tree to hash the data and regenerate the rootHash : * rootHash := MerkleTree([data1, data2, data3]).getRoot() The validators then use pubi to verify signature si on the rootHash: * verifySignature(rootHash, s1 , pub1) => valid/invalid * verifySignature(rootHash, s2 , pub1) => valid/invalid * verifySignature(rootHash, s3 , pub1) => valid/invalid Once all signatures are valid, the validators agree that all accounts stored in the message belong to the same user. From n pairs of chainId and public key , the validators calculate the respective addresses of the user. To eliminate useless addresses, the validators perform additional checks on the age of the address, its average balance, or the total number of transactions related to the address. Finally, the validators store the sameAs relationship among the valid addresses of the user on the knowledge graph.

Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address. 2. Transaction history: TRAVA aggregates all transactions of a wallet address across all platforms to calculate various parameters such as (i) transaction amount, (ii) number of liquidations, etc. 3. Loans ratio: represents the debt position of an account, including the Loan-to-balance ratio and Loan-to-investment ratio. 4. Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. 5. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range. The z-score is calculated from the mean and the standard deviation from every corresponding parameter of all accounts. To be more specific, you can read this function in TRAVA whitepaper.', 'A: Age of the wallet (day) The period that the wallet has participated in the crypto market since its first transaction. Average Credit Score The average amount of credit score within a given period of a wallet address.

It can be used to verify that multiple addresses on different chains belong to the same user. The protocol allows TRAVA.FINANCE to provide an overview of anonymous users, including their total cryptos and other digital assets, statistics for their transactions, and their relationships with other blockchain addresses. These types of information and relationships are stored on the cross-chain knowledge graph. The protocol can (i) improve the credit score of the users and their wallet address so that they can get favorable interest rates, (ii) save them transaction fees since they can use up all of their cryptos as collateral in a single transaction, and (iii) allow them to get their cryptos back when they lose one of their wallet address. To implement the protocol, we develop a wallet application so that users can manage their accounts and prove their ownership of multiple accounts. The application provides users with two functionalities: “Add account” and “Create a proof of ownership”. Users can add a new account to the wallet application in multiple ways, e.g., (i) create an account, (ii) import a private key, and (iii) connect to a hardware wallet. To foster their DeFi transactions, they might need to prove that they are the owner of n addresses. To this end, they can use our wallet application to perform a transaction that activates the cross-chain identification protocol. Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators check the accuracy of the data associated with the transaction. If the data is valid, the validators accept the transaction and write the sameAs relationship among the owners of the addresses to the knowledge graph. In the following we describe our processing to verify the cross-chain identification of multiple wallet addresses.', ': Withdraw an asset Step 1. Open https://app.trava.finance/pools Step 2.

We also try to extend the support of TravaGPT on other chat platforms like Telegram to help users reduce the users effort when using lending pools (Trava lending pool, and others). Related to the risk, I would say there are no risks because all application logic is on the contracts. GPT is the only gateway (aka a smart interface) to call the app logic.

For example , assuming that we run a Fortune Mining pool for users to deposit DAI and gain 20.000 DAI in total deposited after one week. With APY at 1.5% (that is converted to APR at about 0,92%) and APR at 4.08%, respectively, two weeks later, the total reward for the winner will be calculated as: _20000 (0.92%+ 4.08%)/365 14 = 38.356 DAI._ That means if you deposit 100 DAI at first and become the lucky one, you will receive about $38,356 (the interest rate at about 1000%) instead of $0,19 (the interest rate at about 5%). As in the example above, the gap between the rewards you could get in a normal pool and the Fortune Mining pool is very significant. For that reason, this mini-game will be a good choice for those with small capital to try their luck and get much more money than usual. To sum up, what do you need to do to attain the benefits?

About TRAVA.FINANCE Trava.Finance is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. Based on the Knowledge Graph, Trava performs blockchain data analysis to enhance user experience, increase profit and decrease risks for all users. Credit Score Evaluation is the first analysis that Trava.Finance focuses on and deploys.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

What is veTRAVA?,0.9468,True,"['veTRAVA stands for voting escrow Trava. It is an ERC721 token that acts as evidence of your locking token in the governance module. Every time users create a new lock, they receive a veTRAVA token, storing their locked balance, unlock time, and rewards amount. The longer you lock your tokens, the more voting power you have (and the bigger incentive you can earn). For example, you can vote lock 1,000 TRAVA/rTRAVA for a year to have 250 voting power. Each token locked for four years is equal to 1 voting power. The number of voting power you will receive depends on your locked balance & unlock time.  The minimum locking time is one week, and the maximum locking time is four years. Your voting power gradually decreases as your escrow tokens approach their lock expiry.

The Utilisation Rate determines the borrow interest rates.: Each token in each Pool has a utilization rate at each time , which is defined by the ratio =/U_t = L_t/A_twhere represents total borrows and represents total liquidity. This ratio regulates how much of a deposited token is used in the market. When this ratio approaches 100%, there will be a scarcity of tokens in the Pool. The borrower will be unable to borrow at this time, and the lender will be unable to withdraw funds from the Pool.

After the Trava Lottery and Battlehand, the next game — Fortune Mining, will be soon published on September 8th 2022. Introduction to fortune mining What is Fortune Mining? As mentioned, this is an important component of the Trava Minigame Series. The game is built on the well-known blockchain idea of the No-loss-rewards game, allowing participants to earn big prizes without worrying about losing their money. How does it work? So how exactly does Fortune Mining work? For more details, users first need to deposit their money into the Fortune Mining Pool. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm). That means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones. The benefit Fortune Mining brings to players.', 'Deposit token: To deposit assets in the Trava Fortune mining pool, follow these steps: Step 1. Connect your wallet (on BSC Mainnet) Step 2. Access Fortune Mining. Step 3. Connect your wallet. Step 4. Access the tab “Event”. Step 5. Click the “Deposit” Button. Step 6. After that, a pop-up window will appear: * Click the little down arrow icon and choose the token type you want to deposit * Enter the amount you want to deposit * Click the “ Deposit ” button.

(The more they deposit, the more ticket they own): * To check the details, Connect your wallet (on BSC Mainnet), then click the tab Account * The ticket number will appear as the picture following.', '_Big prize to look for_: While there is no loss to be concerned about, the winner may earn significantly more benefits than they would if they had deposited into the regular pool. For example , assuming that we run a Fortune Mining pool for users to deposit DAI and gain 20.000 DAI in total deposited after one week. With APY at 1.5% (that is converted to APR at about 0,92%) and APR at 4.08%, respectively, two weeks later, the total reward for the winner will be calculated as: _20000 (0.92%+ 4.08%)/365 14 = 38.356 DAI._ That means if you deposit 100 DAI at first and become the lucky one, you will receive about $38,356 (the interest rate at about 1000%) instead of $0,19 (the interest rate at about 5%). As in the example above, the gap between the rewards you could get in a normal pool and the Fortune Mining pool is very significant. For that reason, this mini-game will be a good choice for those with small capital to try their luck and get much more money than usual. To sum up, what do you need to do to attain the benefits? Step 1. Deposit your token into the Fortune Mining Pool Step 2. Waiting for a certain period (depending on each campaign) Step 3 . Check the result: * If you are the lucky one: Congratulations, you get all the rewards from the pool * If you have not been lucky yet, don’t worry, you can withdraw your deposit or keep them in the pool, then try your luck in the next period. Notes: We will soon run a voting snapshot for our community to decide which asset should be put in the Fortune Mining pool. Stay tuned for that.

Once the countdown ends, the auction item will be obtained by the last/highest bidder; The most important rule: 2.5% of the price increase for each bid is distributed to the previous bidder, and the remaining 97.5% would be the income of the auction publisher if it’s the last bid or returned to the bidder when it’s outbid. With the rules, each bidder would either take the 5% share of the next bid or obtain the auction Knight with the price he/she offered. And the first bidder will additionally be free from distributing his/her own 5% to other people. Note: The percentage that the later bidder pays for the earlier bidder is the same as the percentage that the sellers need to pay for the platform. So, 2.5% is also the amount auction publishers pay to the marketplace, which means that after receiving 97.5% of the final bidding price as income, sellers need to pay 2.5% of the income to the NFT marketplace. Therefore, the final payment rate that the sellers receive is 95.06% of the final bid. This fee is utilized for marketing, operating, and functioning.

In it, we mentioned the need for a feature so that we can combine various actions in a single transaction — Smart Wallet. Utilizing Smart Wallet in Trava Station system However, many people may not understand their fundamental mechanisms and profound benefits, and that is why we have this article. Follow along with the content below to answer questions surrounding Smart Wallet, and clarify the importance of it in the Trava Station system. Unveiling the Smart Wallet At its core, a smart wallet is an advanced digital tool designed to enhance the way we store, manage, and interact with our financial assets. Each smart wallet is created and owned by the user, representing them (their proxy) and ensuring absolute control over its operations. Departing from the standard Web3 wallets, smart wallets eliminate the need for private keys or seed phrases, instead rely on smart contracts. These intricate computer programs run on a blockchain, operate based on predefined rules and conditions. Conditions and access permissions are encoded into these self-executing code, rendering Smart Wallet both secure and adaptable for managing financial resources. Smart Wallet and Trava Station When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create a Smart Wallet. To understand why, we must first look at the essence of Trava Station — a transit point for performing actions in one go. Normally, you will have to execute and pay a fee for separate transactions on blockchain, as you cannot perform another action if you have a pending one. In response to that, this upcoming product is intended to reduce both the time you spend switching between Trava platforms, and the fee of making multiple transactions. With Trava Station, your assets will be put into Smart Wallet to be evaluated according to the sequences of actions and parameters you set. It now acts as an intermediary so that the requests of the users can be calculated and fulfilled in one go, making the experience much smoother. While using Trava Station, your assets will be temporarily held in Smart Wallet, then returned to your Main Wallet (Metamask, Trust Wallet,…) after the process is over.', 'W: Wallet reputation A parameter to evaluate the loyalty of holders to the tokens in the set, showing the trust and reputation of the holder in the community.

The NFT will stay there until someone buys it on the Marketplace, at which point the process ends and now your Smart Wallet will hold the money from that sale. Trava Station’s Smart Wallet allows users to create their own routes to execute actions within and between Trava Finance protocols efficiently, particularly with Freight. In addition, there are pre-made routes that you can import from Tramlines to freely use. Smart Wallet also supports storing pre-set rules for specific conditions, which best shows in Junction. This feature includes sequences that won’t run right when you create them, but will be triggered by the system bot when a condition is reached. You can also track all the assets in your Smart Wallet in the Portfolio section of Trava Station. This feature will display your position in the Lending Pool when you use Smart Wallet to perform actions in the pools in the Trava ecosystem. Or as with the example mentioned above — you create an order to sell Armoury items, Portfolio will display those NFTs for sale, and the amount of money you have in your Smart Wallet. Pervasive Benefits of Smart Wallets Smart Wallet is absolutely necessary for Trava Station to work. It provides a smoother DeFi experience by allowing users to combine several transactions into one, minimizing the fee of performing multiple actions at the same time, and so on. Smart Wallet brings more convenient experience while still offering enhanced security, satisfying not only new users but also experienced ones. Thanks to the versatility of smart contracts, it can break user reliance on private keys, offer advantageous new features and provide a better experience. In their development, Smart Wallets also presented a number of other uses, such as allowing multisig transactions, or extra layer of security through authenticating apps. They are also capable of limiting daily transaction amounts, reducing the possibility of costly errors and stopping attackers from emptying your wallet. These are all potential benefits of Smart Wallet that can be applied to Trava Station, which have been looked into and / or currently being developed by the Trava team. Conclusion Smart Wallet marks a pivotal juncture in our journey, offering heightened security and streamlined accessibility for Trava Station. We stand poised to significantly enhance your DeFi experience, formulating an effective ecosystem amidst this evolving landscape.

How much should I keep my health factor at to avoid liquidation penalty?,0.9212,True,"['How to avoid being liquidated?  In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2.']","[""Introduction: In borrowing, when a borrowers’ health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value, a liquidation process might happen. In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty?: The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated?: In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2. PreviousTesting TravaNextTroubleshooting Last updated 2 years ago Was this helpful?"", 'What is Health factor?: Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation?: The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals.', 'When do I need to repay the loan?: As long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan. However, the accrued interest of your borrowing will grow day by day, making your health factor decrease. When it reaches the threshold of liquidation, your deposited assets are more likely to fall into liquidation status. How to repay the loan?: In order to pay back the loan you go to the Borrowings section of your dashboard and click on the repay button for the asset you borrowed and want to repay. Select the amount to pay back and approve the transaction.

The difference between the Loan To Value and the Liquidation Threshold is a safety cushion for borrowers.

The borrowed amount is based on the available deposits that you used as collateral. What is the maximum amount can I borrow?: The maximum amount you can borrow depends on your deposited value and the available liquidity. Please notice the health factor and liquidation threshold indicators to guarantee your collaterals are in the state of safety. Besides, you can not borrow if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor is too low.', 'Step 3. Adding assets.: After clicking on “Add asset,” a setting box will appear that requires you to add assets and set different parameters that you want. * To add an asset, first, click on the search bar, and a list of available assets will appear for you to choose from. (Besides these tokens, in the future, you can also propose other assets that you want). After that, our recommendation algorithm will provide a set of parameters, including Reserve Parameter (Loan to Value, Liquidation threshold, Reserve Factor, Liquidation bonus) and Interesting rate strategy (Slope 1 & 2, Utilization optimal, Based interest rate). These parameters are set the same as the Trava Lending pool risk parameters, which are considered effective. However, you can still set the different parameters by filling in reasonable numbers in these different sections. If you want to add another asset, click on “Add asset” and do the same steps as above.', 'Responses (1): Cancel Respond Respond Also publish to my profile See all responses', 'Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).:']","['https://docs.trava.finance/faq/borrowing', 'https://docs.trava.finance/user-guide/lending-pool-user-guide', 'https://docs.trava.finance/faq/borrowing', 'https://docs.trava.finance/faq/borrowing', 'https://docs.trava.finance/user-guide/trava-pool-creation-user-guide', 'https://blog.trava.finance/mini-ama-recap-trava-x-tcv-explore-tcvs-early-seed-round-06d59019f830?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----2----------------------------', 'https://trava.finance/roadmap']",['https://docs.trava.finance/faq/borrowing']

Conclusion Token2049 was not just a conference; it was a testament to the boundless possibilities of blockchain technology. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, events like these serve as beacons of innovation and inspiration for a more equitable and transparent world. Trava Finance is very pleased to have joined Token2049, thereby receiving extremely valuable insights and contributing to our next developments. About Trava.Finance Trava Finance is an AI-driven Lending Station. As the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending, we provide both lending pools like normal approaches, and a more flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own pools. Applying AI technology and automation to our products, Trava Finance aims to bring users the most convenience in the DeFi space and complete decentralization in Web3. Trava Finance is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks.

However, this is still being considered further, based on the market situation and opportunities. Technology & products: Thanks to the discussions about the requirements for creating a convenient DeFi space for users at the Token2049 event, Trava Finance is even more confident to be on the right track — developing Smart Wallet. This tool has been and will continue to be a gateway that allows users to conduct all transactions on DeFi, not just limited to Trava Ecosystem. Besides, our team has heard some talks about upcoming technology trends, like creating super apps on messenger chat. Therefore, we have an idea to build ourselves a Chatbot and integrate it into Telegram to keep up with the flow. We are also currently developing an AI chatbot called Trava GPT, aiming to entirely reduce the barrier for end users on Web3.', 'TRAVA.FINANCE: Connect with TRAVA.FINANCE: Trava Finance is a cross-chain lending marketplace which offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.

Explain in details Trava governace v1 and the vision for version 2,0.8803,True,"['Governance v1  For version 1 of Trava Governance, we present evolution in governance processes with on-chain features enabled. Governance Process  The governance process consists of 2 continuous processes: off-chain & on-chain.      Off-chain process:  In the off-chain process, anyone in the Trava community can raise their opinions and discuss ideas of how the protocol can improve by creating TRC - Trava Request for Comments on the Trava Forum.  After an idea is well-formed, a community member can follow our template for TIP - Trava Improvement Proposal and post on the forum for details feedback. We recommend off-chain voting (powered by snapshot.org) to gain exposure and rough consensus from the community to increase the chance of succeeding in the on-chain process.  When a TIP gets to its final version, the DAO Committee is in charge of the review process and officially proposes on-chain.      On-chain process:  When a TIP is proposed on-chain, it becomes transparent on the public blockchain; anyone possessing voting power can directly vote for or against this proposal.  After the voting period, a TIP will be queued and executed by the public.  The Security Advisory Board acts as a guardian to prevent malicious actions and security exploits in this process. Governance Authority  In governance version 1, the DAO will have authority over the Trava lending protocol. The community will have to agree on any significant changes or updates through the on-chain process. Governance Power  To gain governance power, holders need to lock their Trava or rTrava token in exchange for the veTRAVA token, which holds voting power. This vote locking mechanism encourages users who show a solid commitment to the protocol with more governance power and incentive.', 'In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1  In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc.  In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including:      Discussion: In this stage, Trava holders will discuss different problems on the Trava Forum.     Proposal: On this forum, once a person brings his or her ideas to the platform, the community will determine whether they should be considered by up-voting this proposal. If the community approves, it will be brought on the snapshot in the next step.     Voting off-chain on the snapshot: On the snapshot, users will vote for the proposition they want.     Voting on-chain: After the voting on the snapshot, the whole governance process will then be generated totally on-chain.     Execution: After the stage of making the decision, there are two scenarios. If the proposal is accepted, it will be executed; otherwise, it will be canceled.  In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: the amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time.  Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features:      Democracy: The voting enforcement process is democratic and transparent.     Connectivity: The community members can recommend, discuss, and manage the products and the development direction of the Trava Ecosystem.     Up-to-date: The community members can recommend the latest technologies and features based on the market trend that help the whole system make changes to the protocol for the best result.  The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2  Trava is the first one that allows users to create and manage their own lending pool. In the future, governance will play a significant role in the initialization movements and their operation in the future.  In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process.  Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.']","['1.

There are those who gave not only one but dozens of different opinions, on many aspects and products of Trava Finance. From there, we have selected 10 ideas to proceed further: 1. Open a contest for community members to create their own knights. 2. Restructure the main page of Trava, removing the mountains with links to make it seem more user-friendly and easier to understand Trava\'s focus. 3. Expand to other chains and add new ones, since BNB is in a potentially risky position. 4. Add more DeFi protocols to BRicher, regularly updating good protocols and removing unsafe ones. 5. Simplify the parameters in Lending Pools and add more tokens. Add a type of notification so people would know when liquidations are close. 6. Increase the utility of TRAVA tokens by adding continuous token burn feature, periodically burning minted TRAVA. Allow them to be exchanged on all chains in Trava Lending. 7. Reopen BNB/Trava safety passbook. 8. Launch Knights leasing feature. 9. Do Idea Contest more periodically. 10. Start marketing on Crew3. Motivation: Each of the ideas has been thoroughly researched by us, evaluated for their potential and feasibility. Don\'t be sad if your ideas are not here, they might just be slightly deviating from Trava Finance\'s development orientation, or not yet capable of being put into practice. This discussion is open in order to be able to involve the whole community in contributing to the development of Trava Finance. It’s expected to be a stepping stone before starting the voting snapshot, for everyone to dive deeper into these ideas and voice their own comments. From there, it is also possible for you to pick the best choices for the development of Trava, choosing a worthy winner (or winners). The founders and POs of Trava Finance will also check out this discussion, so don\'t be afraid to dig into each issue and ask the hard questions.

Therefore, we’d like to raise opinions from you guys on: Should TravaGPT support the Polish language? What do you think about this idea? Let’s cast your vote & share your thoughts now! Trava Administration 3 Jul 2024, 21:00 * Call for suggestions to improve Trava Station to best suits your demands. posted in Lending 1. Idea As announced recently, we are preparing to launch the Trava Station. Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. 2. Information Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, Freight is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes Smart Wallet , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the main interface of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don’t have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA. With Trava Freight, all those laborious, time-consuming and costly steps can be combined into a single transaction. In the current version, the scope of implementation with Freight in particular and Trava Station in general is still quite limited, mainly focusing on Lending Pool, Marketplaces, users\' wallets… The actions include borrowing, returning assets, adding liquidity or withdrawing, executing conversion orders, buying or selling NFTs, tokens or other digital assets. Of course, we will develop the platform further, add more activities and features in the future, so that everyone has a truly seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. Portfolio is where you can keep track of your position and all your assets in Smart Wallet in Trava Station. Tramlines and Junction are complementary features to Freight, in which Tramlines provide a list of pre-made sequences with arranged actions for you to import. Meanwhile, Junction consists of sequences that are not executed when you create, but are made active by a system bot only when a condition is reached. * For example, you can create a set of actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price reaches $1000 — so when this threshold appears, our system bot will execute the pre-arranged actions. 3. Ask After reading the above information, you may have understood a little more about Trava Station and our vision, right? We treasure all your opinions, because you are who Trava Station was built to serve. So let us know what you think about this upcoming product, suggesting for further development!!

With the implementation of the Trava Governance Vault, users can lock their TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB into this vault to receive a certain amount of veTRAVA representing their powers: the more veTRAVA you own, the higher your voting power in the Trava ecosystem. The Benefits Of Owning veTRAVA  The key value of veTRAVA is its representative of users’ power and their commitment to the project. As a result, in the long term, users who own veTRAVA can receive significant benefits:      Deciding on crucial parameters such as LTV, risk parameters, etc., in the lending pools (Trava Lending Pool and Users-owned Pools).     Receiving share profit coming from the fee charged by borrowers     Receiving boosting rewards in rTRAVA by providing liquidity and holding veTRAVA at the same time.     Earning TRAVA reward: the APR will be revealed soon.  As mentioned, veTRAVA is utilized as a form of NFT. For now, it can only be available for those who lock their token into the Governance Vault. However, it will be exchanged peer-to-peer with the launch of veTRAVA Marketplace. veTRAVA Marketplace: Overview  As its name suggests, the veTRAVA marketplace is for users to buy and sell their veTRAVA. It means they can freely exchange their voting power. The main reason we came up with this idea is to optimize users’ experience, bringing them as much freedom as possible. It’s the “Decentralization” we are heading for.  Besides bringing more freedom to users, veTRAVA Marketplace increases liquidity for veTRAVA and thus benefits both sellers and buyers. In more detail, buyers can buy veTRAVA (voting power) easily on Marketplace and then earn voting power immediately. In this case, the remaining locking time will be more flexible, no longer limited to a particular period set in the Governance Vault. When it comes to sellers, they can easily utilize crypto assets in a more liberal way and get benefits from it. The Influences of veTRAVA Marketplace  veTRAVA Marketplace is an important feature that contributes to the development of Trava Governance. As mentioned above, users who hold many veTRAVA will have a crucial role in the decision-making process of the Trava Finance ecosystem. The veTRAVA holders can alternate the voting results, and through the Marketplace, users can buy or sell the voting power with others.  With the fact that users can trade their voting power to each other, anyone in the ecosystem will have a chance to vote for the changes they want to make in Trava Finance. The more users have veTRAVA, the more voting power is distributed, and users will be given the full power to make the decisions that can affect the Decentralized Lending Marketplace, which will elevate the decentralized side of Trava Finance’s ultimate goal.']","[""V: veTRAVA veTRAVA stands for voting escrow Trava.

Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation?  The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated.

In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty?: The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated?: In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2.

I want to know the details of TRAVA's audit across all auditor platforms.,0.8592,True,"['Audit completion by Certik Audit Scope  The audit focused on the following considerations:      Testing the smart contracts against both common and uncommon attack vectors.      Assessing the codebase to ensure compliance with current best practices and industry standards.      Ensuring contract logic meets the specifications and intentions of the client.      Cross-referencing contract structure and implementation against similar smart contracts produced by industry leaders.      Thorough line-by-line manual review of the entire codebase by industry experts  Findings:  There are seven issues found in total, including 1 Minor Finding, 2 Informational Findings, and 4 Major Findings.  Firstly, one Minor and Two Informational Issues concern some coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused functions, missing zero addresses checking, and function type. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.  Secondly, all four Major Issues are related to Centralization. The owners of the following contracts below can execute some functions without obtaining the consensus of the community:      FactoryRegistry,      AddressesProviderFactory      PoolUpdateControl      LendingPoolConfigurator   Certik Recommendations for the Centralization Issue:  Certik advised to carefully manage the governance/guardian account’s private key to avoid any potential risks of being hacked. In general, Certik strongly recommended centralized privileges or roles in the protocol to be improved via a decentralized mechanism or via smart-contract-based accounts with enhanced security practices, e.g. Multisignature wallets.  Some feasible solutions recommended by Certik that would also mitigate the potential risk include:      Time-lock with reasonable latency, i.e. 48 hours, for awareness on privileged operations;      Assignment of privileged roles to multi-signature wallets to prevent a single point of failure due to the private key;      Introduction of a DAO/governance/voting module to increase transparency and user involvement.  Trava Solutions for the Centralization Issue  Trava has partially resolved these issues via smart-contract-based accounts. In particular:      Deploy a Multi-Signature wallet in BSC mainnet at the address:   0xdF73aC573Dfd430f4C5558B8CbeD86e86145501B      Set up the owner of the contracts and governance to the multi-signature wallet.  Although these issues are major, our approach can avoid the potential risks of centralization. Moreover, in our roadmap, we will enable DAO Functionalities in Q2–2022. The introduction of the DAO module will completely resolve the centralization issues. This approach will make our community control the process and activity of Trava Finance in the near future.', 'Audit completion by Hacken  This thorough security audit checked and ensured the following imperative points as 2 main Categories (1) Code review (2) Functional.  The audit report contains all found security vulnerabilities and other issues in the reviewed code. As a result of the audit, There are no critical issues in our contracts. Besides, Hacken’s security engineers found 4 high, 4 medium, and 3 low severity issues. Overall, after the auditing process, Hacken evaluated Trava’s contracts as Well-Secured (the highest level of security as the assessment). Severity High  There is one issue regarding the implementation function and three issues regarding uninitialized state variables:      Issue 1 (unimplemented function): The logic of function finalizeTranfer has commented-out unimplemented logic. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.      Issues 2, 3, 4 (uninitialized state variables): Some state variables are not initialized for the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager but they are being called.          Trava’s Response: We consider the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager as a Logic Contract where we execute our code by using delegate call from LendingPool Contract. That explains why we don’t initialize the state for that variable.          Following the verification, Hacken determined that these are not issues.  Severity Medium  There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused imports, Not checked contract address, and No event on lendingPoolConfigurator change. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.  There is one Issue concerning Possible FlashLoan attack in the LendingPool contract. Despite the fact that we do not believe this attack could happen in real life, we took great care in resolving the problem.  Description: IF both of TToken and its underlyingAsset are traded on multiple DEXes and have different rates there could be a FlashLoan attack. Attackers could FlashLoan a TToken, and process withdraw, which will give then the exact same amount of the underlyingAsset, and then calling deposit, they will receive the same amount of TToken.  Having the 1-to-1 “exchange” on the LendingPool and different rates on DEXes, attackers could “play” with the market many times in one transaction until they receive enough rewards. The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.  The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.  Hacken’s Recommendation: Consider some restrictions like minting/returning assets in the next block only.  Trava’s solution: Token transfer restrictions for transferring in the same block where minting occurred.  After the verification, Hacken concluded that the issue had been resolved completely. Severity Low  There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to Unused state variable, public/external function, Unused function argument. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.']","['TRAVA.FINANCE: Connect with TRAVA.FINANCE: Trava Finance is a cross-chain lending marketplace which offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.

Explain EXP and how can I use it for Farming,0.9992,True,"['At the moment, EXP (Experience Point) is the point that shows how long an Armoury NFT is staked in our vaults. EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault.  Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault  We’ve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items).  You can see your EXP  either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace.  Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs. However, when you withdraw your Knight NFT, disassemble and reassemble with different items to get another Knight NFT, your Armoury NFTs will have different EXPs.  For example: You open 4 chests and get: Helmet, Shield, Armour and Weapon. You assemble them into a Knight NFT and farm in our vault. After 24h, the EXPs for Armoury NFTs are as follow:      Weapon EXP: 86400      Shield EXP: 86400      Armor EXP: 86400      Helmet EXP: 86400  So EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400 (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400  After 24h, you withdraw your Knight NFT to reassemble with Armoury NFTs you buy on Trava NFT Marketplace. Suppose, those Armoury NFTs you bought have been already farmed in vault before and have the EXPs as follow:      Weapon EXP: 86400      Shield EXP: 100000      Armor EXP: 320000      Helmet EXP: 210000  Thus, the EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100 (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100  There will be a lot of benefits for NFT owners to have high EXPs. The more EXP you have, the more value the NFT will be. This can help you to distinguish NFT value from other NFTs of the same type and rarity. Moreover, the EXP will be applied in our Trade-up Mechanism which will be launched soon. In the future, EXP will be used with Credit Score and applied to NFT-collateralization. It can be said that EXP is an important factor in Trava Knight NFT to reach our goal of collateralization.', 'Heuristic Farming (Farming based on EXP)  When the new Farming mechanism commences, our 5 current Farming vaults will stop distributing TRAVA as reward, which means our 5 existing vaults will only give back EXP (one EXP for each second in 5 current farming vaults). This change supports NFT owners to gain EXP to enter Heuristic Farming with better rewards.  In the new Farming mechanism, we provide  5 more vaults for Heuristic Farming, and you can deposit as many knights as you want into each Vault, provided that those knights have the same rarity as that Vault. Rewards from Heuristic Farming are rTRAVA tokens and EXP (one EXP for every 3 seconds in the vault). The higher EXP, the higher the APR, the higher the rTRAVA reward.  Normal Farming  Heuristic Farming  Number of vaults  5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities  5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities  Number of Knights allowed in one vault  1 Knight  ≥≥1 Knight  Reward in tokens  None  rTRAVA  EXP reward  One EXP is released for each second Knights in the vaults  One EXP is released for 3 second Knights in the vaults  With the new and improved mechanism, the EXP points are a crucial element in the development of the Trava Knight NFT journey. Like the current Farming mechanism, Heuristic Farming also has a Polishing mechanism.

What is Token Health and how can it measure a crypto risk?,0.8435,False,"['What is Token Health?  Token Health is an index to evaluate the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava is the world-first lending platform that provides this index by collecting and aggregating various types of data from blockchain networks. The health of each token is evaluated as a specific value in the range of [0; 1000]. This health index gives the users a comprehensive overview of tokens in the cryptocurrency world and thus facilitates TRAVA lending and other DEFI businesses. Original features in Trava Token Health  Standardizing value for each indicator: There have been a few projects providing information on tokens such as Coingecko, CoinMarketCap, LunarCrush, CREAM Finance, DMM Exchange, etc. They typically present multiple types of on-chain data represented by raw numbers only. For example, they show the market capitalization of tokens but do not standardize those values, which makes it harder for users to understand the meaning of the values or make a comparison among different tokens. Performing standardization for the numeric indicators, Trava allows users to quickly assess different tokens in terms of MarketCap, Trading Volume, Token Price, etc.  Aggregate all indicators into a single index: Similar projects simply present multiple token indicators to users without combining them into a single index to make a comprehensive assessment of tokens. Trava Token Health Model, which is a user-oriented model, has been built to address this inconvenience by computing those separate indicators and combining all of them into an insightful index, i.e., Token Health. Users can use this single value to evaluate the health of a token and can quickly decide to invest in the token or not.  Utilizing both absolute and relative indicators: The absolute indicators are commonly used in many token-analyzing projects, while relative values are typically being overlooked. The absolute and separated values do not provide many complete insights, as those values \u200b\u200bare not correlated with each other. Different from other projects, Trava makes use of both absolute and relative indicators to evaluate the Token Health in the most precise and overall manner. Let us take an example with tokens A and B. The trading volume of token A is $100M, while that of token B is $10M. People tend to quickly jump to the conclusion that token A outweighs token B with regards to the trading volume. However, when considering the market cap of the two tokens, it shows that the MarketCap of token A is 1000 times greater than that of token A. Thus, in the correlation with the MarketCap, the trading volume of token B is in fact much more impressive than that of token A. The example shows that, by combining absolute and relative indicators, Trava Model provides more comprehensive insights compared with related projects.  Customized UI for each user: The UI for Trava Token Heath can be customized for individual preference. Trava provides users with the leaderboard of all tokens, ranked by the total score (i.e., Token Health) or other single indicators such as market cap, token price, and trading volume. Users can access the historical charts of each indicator to get more insights. Moreover, what makes Trava Token Health special compared to the related projects is that Trava enables users to customize the charts based on their preferences. For example, they can add their favorite tokens with their preferable indicators in a single chart to compare and evaluate multiple tokens in an easy, time-saving, and elegant manner.  Various types of indicators: The Trava Token Health model is constructed based on various parameters in different aspects of DeFi. There are seven main parameters; all are selected and analyzed under a strict process before being deployed to ensure the most reliability and creditworthiness. In addition to the absolute values, we also calculate and analyze the relative values such as: the price over the highest score or the trading volume over the MarketCap. We also consider the fluctuation of the values over time. The detailed model will be presented in the next section Trava Token Health model  Trava has studied and developed an exclusive token rating model. The model takes into account various types of data. At present, the data is grouped into seven main indicators including (1) Market cap, (2) Number of transactions, (3) Volume of transactions, (4) Number of holders, (5) Distribution of tokens to holders, (6) Price, and (7) Price stability. Each indicator in turn is evaluated based on several sub-parameters. The use of Trava Token Health  One of the significant benefits of Token Health is to reduce risks. When participating in the crypto world, users have to face many types of risks such as token price crashes or collateral liquidation when borrowing. Token Health will be a useful tool for users to minimize these risks. They can determine which tokens should not be invested at certain times to avoid risks. Let us take an example of how two major risks can be addressed by Trava Token Health:      Risk of token liquidity. In the DeFi field, price fluctuations can result in risks of loan liquidation for both the pool owners and liquidity providers. With Trava Token Health, the pool owner can choose stable price tokens to allow performing actions in the pool to avoid this risk.     Risk of token inflation. Tokens with high inflation are more likely to have a price crash. Users in DeFi can suffer significant losses due to such crashes. With Trava Token Health, users have a full overview of token price, using our price stability indicator, the price over the highest score, or the Token Health index. This information is an effective tool for users to avoid the risk of tokens’ price crashes.  Moreover, Trava Token Health assists users to make optimal decisions on token investing. In the past, choosing which tokens to invest, lend or borrow, was a major problem for users in the crypto world because there was no credible basis for them to assess the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava Token Health allows users to observe the history of multiple token indicators and the overall Token Health index to be more confident when making their investment decisions.']","['P: Price score in tokens health analytics The quotient of the current token price and the highest token price in the last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 100 days, and all-time.

PreviousBricher GlossaryNextTraDAO Glossary Last updated 2 years ago', 'How to increase my credit score?: To improve the credit score of your wallet, you would need to take into account our five parameters, i.e., Total asset, Transaction history, Loans ratios, Circulating assets, and Trustworthiness of possessing assets. For instance, you should increase your wallet balance with prestige coins and tokens, perform more transactions and become more active in the crypto market, maintaining good Loan-to-balance and Loan-to-investment ratios, supply more liquidity to lending pools, trade on lending DApps to earn as much profit as you can, avoid collateral liquidation while borrowing, and possess at least $1000 valuable token (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, or BNB). Besides, you need to be credible users for a long time. It is because to avoid fraud, TRAVA calculates some credit score parameters based on their average values in the last k days, where k depends on the volatility of the crypto market. Moreover, some parameters are assessed based on the “standardized score” function, which calculates the mean and the standard deviation of all accounts’ parameters. Thus, trying to be the best at some criteria would improve your credit score too.', 'C: Circulating asset (Credit Score parameters) The circulating-asset-to-total-asset ratio represents how active users are in the crypto market.

Information: Trava Capital is an important pillar of our ecosystem, which currently provides users with two main investment models — Treasury and Crowdfunding. It has been and is still bringing benefits to the community, however, our team foresees its even brighter future. Our goal is to build a trustless market-making infrastructure & strategies on DEX V3, as well as Lending pool on multi-chains, with the integration of AI technology. From there, Liquidity providers can utilize our features to have their liquidity managed in an automated, capital-efficient, non-custodial, and transparent manner. We hope to democratize market-making, enabling DEXs and Lending to become the primary trading venue for all assets, even beyond crypto.', ""What are the TRAVA token and its utility?: We issue TRAVA tokens based on Binance smart chain's BEP-20 standard; the total supply is 5 billion. These TRAVA tokens can be used in: * Reward: Pool owners can set up rewards paid by TRAVA token. Thus, lending pool depositors will earn rewards by TRAVA token. * Collateral and lending: Users can use TRAVA as mortgages. The users also loan TRAVA. * Payment for lending fees: Users can pay pool lending fees by TRAVA. * Payment for pool management: Pool owners can pay for the pool creation, update (e.g., pool parameters, add/remove tokens, …), and pause by TRAVA. * Payment for auction deposits: in the NFTs auction process, TRAVA can be used as a locked asset. * Payment for auction organization: To perform all auction actions for NFT, the NFT’s owners (auction organizers) can pay the auction fees by TRAVA. * Staking for a data validator: To store credit data stored on the knowledge graph chain, the data must be confirmed by validators. The process is built up to eliminate redundant, unnecessary, and insecure data. The knowledge graph data validators stake by TRAVA. * Staking to participate in the governance process: TRAVA.FINANCE will become a community solution, thus the TRAVA.FINANCE’s rules are elected by participants, who hold TRAVA’s token."", 'Brief description of Trava: TRAVA is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA also offers the credit score function based on financial data on-chain analysis as a useful tool that reduces risk and increases profits for all users. We build our solutions on TRAVA.FINANCE whose smart contracts are deployed on BSC network, so the speed of transactions, gas fees, and robustness depend on BSC network. However, in the near future, we will allow cross-chain lending in our platform. Please join the the Trava team and members of the community look forward to helping you understand and use Trava. Why should we trust Trava?: Trava Protocol has been audited and secured internally, by third parties (Hacken, Certik) and even Community Checks.

Explain TRADAO and its public offering.,0.8738,True,"['What is TRADAO?  TRADAO is the world’s first protocol supporting multi-chain deployment in DeFi 2.0, and also Web 3.0 compatible. TraDAO is protocol owned liquidity (POL), accumulating value through such activities of bonding and auto-compound staking which are regulated by Trava Treasury. As a product in Trava ecosystem, the liquidity owned by TRADAO protocol could be deposited in Trava Lending Pool to generate more profit and this profit will be shared among users in the entire Trava ecosystem.  TRADAO Protocol will issue a decentralized reserve currency — called TOD. The concept behind TOD token is that it is backed by a basket of assets in Trava Treasury that ensures it does not fall below its base value of $1. The TOD token will be released based on the “Mint & Burn” mechanism, managed by no one other than TRADAO protocol. Why is TRADAO different compared to other OHM forks?  In comparison to other initiatives in the DeFi 2.0 space, TRADAO Protocol offers a number of unique advantages to users. How does it work?  Our Bonding allows users to buy TOD at a discounted price compared with exchanges in other assets such as stablecoins, LP tokens, and so on. The number of TOD tokens that the bonder is entitled to will be vested in a certain term.  Bond Installment is a one-of-a-kind feature that allows users to buy more TOD with a little initial amount of assets, then leverage benefits in Staking Strategy, and pay off the debt. Your bond shall be automatically staked after you use Bond Installment.  Wallet Reputation will be integrated with this product in the form of a reference to decide which user will have more benefits (i.e, lower prepaid rate, lower interest fee rate, higher liquidation discount rate,…). For example, holding assets in the Trava Ecosystem can be considered as a condition to gain a high wallet reputation.  Our Staking allows bonders to stake their TOD token in our auto-compounding vault and earn rebase rewards, after receiving TOD tokens from bond sales. The rebase rewards are also from bond sales held in Trava treasury, or profit of the protocol.', 'We are opening two public offering rounds to give our loyal users as well as our new investors more opportunities to take part in the TraDAO Protocol at the very first stage. In both rounds, participants will buy $TOD tokens in BUSD. The details of two rounds are as the table below:  To get off to a good start, Trava will contribute to TraDAO Protocol with $50,000 worth of 20,000 $TOD tokens. This support is to ensure initial liquidity of $TOD and show the commitment of Trava team in developing TraDAO protocol, thus bringing trust to our community and staying the true ideology of Trava since the beginning, that is a fair launch project and independent of any whale or VCs. The funds from sale will be used to back the $TOD sold and provide initial liquidity after listing.  If we are 100% subscribed, the sale will bring in $345,000. $105,000 will be deposited to the treasury to back initial supply. The remaining $240,000 will be added as liquidity. The LP will open on PancakeSwap with 240,000 BUSD and 20,000 $TOD, in addition to 85,000 $TOD from Public Offering and contribution of Trava Team. This means the starting price of $TOD is $12, and total initial liquidity on Pancakeswap is $480,000 of both tokens. Thus, the total Initial Supply of $TOD will be 105,000 $TOD. How can I join Public Offering?  We will also open two (02) Rounds of Whitelist, which will then be merged to one Final Whitelist at the end. The two rounds open to welcome new Knights and incentives for Loyal Knights in the TRAVA ecosystem as follows:      Whitelist Round 1 (will be live on Jan 21st) — Power up TRADAO — To welcome new members into TRAVA Ecosystem     Whitelist Round 2 (will be live on Jan 28th) — Cheer up Trava Knights — To honor TRAVA loyal users  Participants in the Final Whitelist will have a lucky ticket in buying $TOD Token at the cheapest price before it hits the official launch on PancakeSwap. When you buy, you are removed from the whitelist; if some people buy less than their share, everyone who has not yet bought will get a higher allocation. The details of each Round will be released in our next announcements.  After the public offering rounds, we plan to open two strategies of Bonding and Staking for users to leverage their rewards and earn profit from them. We also have a plan to allow Bond Installment and Wallet Reputation for Bond purchases, which creates a perfect gateway for users with small funds to invest and profit from the protocol.']","['1. Idea: Starting from TraDAO and turning into Trava Capital, its growth is closely connected to our community. Correspondingly, when technology reaches another high and the market is in a bullish phase with many opportunities awaiting, it’s time for renovation and innovation. Therefore, our team has discussed carefully and had the first thoughts about the updates we can make with Trava Capital. We intend to separate it from Trava Finance into its own being — an AI platform that enables running liquidity provision strategies on blockchains.

Note that APYs provided are ballpark level indicators and not precise future results. Auto-compound Staking The rewards from the staking program are compounded.
