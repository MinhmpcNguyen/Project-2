Trava Station Trava Station serves as a center of Trava Finance, aiming to help users in the Trava ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving them time and money when making transactions. With Trava Station, instead of having to move between dApps and platforms to perform actions, you can combine them all together in one transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time and gas costs compared to when doing separate actions. Let’s see how you can aggregate multiple actions in one transaction and how much gas fees you can save in the picture below. Save more with Trava Station At present, Trava Station has 6 features: ➡️ Freight : Allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands. ➡️ Tramlines : Provides a list of pre-made shortcuts to do common actions. ➡️ Junction : Allow users to pre-set transactions to be auto-executed when the conditions are met. ➡️ Portfolio : A real-time report that keeps track of all your activities and assets in Trava Station. ➡️ Analytics : Get real-time analysis of the market as well as user preference in Trava Finance. ➡️ Recommendations : Provide a thorough analysis and prediction of DEXs’ parameters.

Using a smart wallet offers more advantages for users: * Save fees and streamline transaction process : They enable a smoother DeFi experience by combining multiple transactions into one, reducing transaction fees. * Enhanced user experience and privacy : Smart Wallets offer convenience while improving security, appealing to both new and experienced users by utilizing smart contracts to reduce dependence on private keys. * Additional features and security : Smart Wallets can support multi-signature transactions, add extra layers of security through app authentication, limit daily transaction amounts, and prevent potential errors or theft. Smart Wallet is incorporated in Trava Station and TravaGPT to optimize DeFi actions for users in Trava Finance. Specifically, with Trava Station, your assets are temporarily moved to a Smart Wallet to execute all your actions in a single transaction, making the process smoother. After the actions are completed, your assets are returned to your main wallet (like Metamask or Trust Wallet). To have your own Smart Wallet, you just need to connect your wallet to Trava Finance and go to the Freight tab of Trava Station to create it.

The Utilisation Rate determines the borrow interest rates.: Each token in each Pool has a utilization rate at each time , which is defined by the ratio =/U_t = L_t/A_twhere represents total borrows and represents total liquidity. This ratio regulates how much of a deposited token is used in the market. When this ratio approaches 100%, there will be a scarcity of tokens in the Pool. The borrower will be unable to borrow at this time, and the lender will be unable to withdraw funds from the Pool.

We should get away from it completely and just stick with USDC and Tether for now. BNB: Due to global regulators attacking CZ which is BNB really, we should be cautious and begin expanding to more chains quickly in case anything happens to BNB. I feel if BNB goes down Trava is done for since most of its utility is on that chain. That's a huge risk that the team cannot control that has nothing to do with Trava and its investors so we should protect accordingly and diversify. @jefe811 said in IdeaContest--Lending Pool-Trava Knight-Trava Capital: Adding more new chains. Having BNB, ETH, and FTM is great. But, more are needed. Maybe we could put out voting for this issue and which ones to choose. The other issue is most Trava features are just for the BNB chain. ETH and FTM chain users should have all the same feature use as BNB. If they did I feel the TVL on these chains would increase drastically. Agree, there will be pulsechain, fork eth 2.0 much cheaper and faster than eth or polygon matic, and cosmos are cheap aswell and fast, matic is strong project @jefe811 said in IdeaContest--Lending Pool-Trava Knight-Trava Capital: Trava Capital: Trava capital needs a lot of help. It is impossible to understand what money in reserves is actually there. Also what is the actual token circulation count? Coinmarketcap and Coingecko need updates on the token since the price is not tracked anymore. No way for investors to know what the value per token is based off of reserve assets. There should be a visually easy view of token reserves or investments along with their daily market price then divided amongst the circulation we now all know the value per token. I feel a team is needed just for this protocol and if there is one and that's all they do, then we need more folks. We also need more communication. My biggest fear for Trava capital it seems to be a blatant or obvious security or stock share the way it is designed now. Being from the USA I may not be allowed to trade these in the future unfortunately. Thats point, Team should not, skip this kinda situation, its looks bad on view, when tokens is just non tracked. Also we dont know how money left for investing, etc We need more partnership with project, some ama with other group/teams for marketing trava capital and trava token. @jefe811 said in IdeaContest--Lending Pool-Trava Knight-Trava Capital: Trava should use some of the transaction fees earned to complete monthly or quarterly burn of the original amount of minted Trava. This should stay in place permanently. This will only make the price of Trava more valuable. Thats not bad idea, for price token, but honestly i prefer keep money for marketing with others project/people ama's partnerships etc, in social media is silent, i had proposal fore crew 3 but aswell is silent about this idea, we dont have much retweets/likes on tt page compare for followers, dunno why.

In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid.

The total asset represents the financial strength of the wallet address; it is the most intuitive and easiest-to-evaluate parameter. It is also the second most important parameter that affects credit scores. The total asset is the sum of balance and total investment minus total liabilities. The credit score of the address is proportional to its total asset. As this parameter is a volatility index, the credit score is calculated based on both the average total asset in a certain period and the total current asset. Transaction history. Transaction history is the most important parameter; it has a major impact on credit scores. TRAVA.FINANCE collects and aggregates all exchanges, loans, deposits, and other transactions of the wallet address across multiple DApps to calculate various intermediate parameters such as (i) the age of the address, (ii) its transaction amount, (iii) its frequency of transaction, (iv) its number of liquidations and (v) its total value of liquidations. Loan ratios. Loan ratios (debt ratios) represent the debt position of the account. It is divided into two sub-parameters, i.e., loan-to-balance ratio and loan-to-investment ratio. Circulating assets. This parameter represents how active users are in the crypto market. The more money they invest in the crypto market, the more creditworthiness they gain from others. This parameter is evaluated based on 2 sub-parameters, (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE (Return on equity). Trustworthiness of possessing assets. The last parameter for credit rating is the trustworthiness of the assets owned by the wallet address. The wallet can improve its credit score by possessing high-value and trustworthy digital assets. At present, TRAVA.FINANCE evaluates two types of digital assets only (i.e, Token and NFT).']","[""How the user's credit score will be updated?: Our system has both periodic updates and instant updates.

Once the countdown ends, the auction item will be obtained by the last/highest bidder; The most important rule: 2.5% of the price increase for each bid is distributed to the previous bidder, and the remaining 97.5% would be the income of the auction publisher if it’s the last bid or returned to the bidder when it’s outbid. With the rules, each bidder would either take the 5% share of the next bid or obtain the auction Knight with the price he/she offered.

What are benefit for those who participate in the Trava Knight auction?,0.9089,True,"['Benefit for those who participate in the Trava Knight auction Benefit for auction publishers (the sellers) Auction publishers (or sellers) are those who open auctions for their Knights. Opening an auction allows auction publishers to set up their price floor for their Knights, which determines their minimum desired price, helping them avoid selling their Knights at an unwanted low price compared to the market price. The auction opens a great opportunity for Knight owners to make profits without the need of disassembling their Knights to pieces and selling each item multiple times, which can cause wasted gas fees due to multiple transactions. Benefit for bidders Trava Knight auction is of benefit for bidders since it offers them the opportunity to get the full Knight, not every piece of armoury NFT on Trava NFT Marketplace. This helps bidders save more time in obtaining a Knight without finding and collecting armoury items to assemble. The auction also offers bidders an excellent method to get their favorable Knights, which suits their needs for missions such as Farming, Expedition, Farming with EXP and PvP tournaments in the future. Benefit for Trava Lending Pool The NFT Auction is the first step toward Trava Finance’s long-term aim of allowing NFTs to be used as collateral in the Trava Lending pool. By using an auction mechanism, the NFT will be priced and subsequently used as collateral in the Trava loan pool. This is a good method to vary the collaterals and give users more opportunities to lend assets.  ', 'Benefits of Knight NFTs Each of Knight and Armory NFTs represents a unique digital collectible that can be bought, sold, rented and put on auction on Trava Knight NFT Marketplace. It helps increase the utility of not only NFTs for NFT-collateralization, but also $TRAVA in our system as all the trading on the Marketplace is in $TRAVA. Users can assemble Knight NFTs to join Trava Farming Programs (NFT Farming, Heuristic Farming) in different vaults for a great APY — the rarer the NFT, the higher APY. The longer staked in the vaults, Loyal Knight NFT holders will also have more benefits in our lending pool in the future. In addition, you can get rewards from Trava Knight NFTs by playing the Battle Hand Mini-Game, and joining in Missions such as Expedition or Treasure Map.  ', 'TRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below. NFT owners can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it. TRAVA.FINANCE thus increases the liquidity of NFTs and opens up a unique and exciting NFTFi marketplace. Based on the given number of auction bids, bidders have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session. This rewarding mechanism provides incentives for users to actively make a bid in the auction. Auction winners can get their desired NFT at a price lower than their bidding price (once NFT owners cannot repay the loan) or they can receive considerable interest from their loan to NFT owners (once NFT owners repay the loans and get their NFT back). The credit scores of NFT owners, auction winners, bidders, and NFTs can be improved after auctions. The auction mechanism for NFT can also be applied to any type of digital asset.

Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way.

What are the features of Trava Finance?,0.9166,True,"['There are six salient features of TRAVA.FINANCE, including: Crypto lending marketplace: TRAVA.FINANCE creates a marketplace in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and obtain greater earnings. Semantic knowledge graph: TRAVA.FINANCE is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA.FINANCE to efficiently search for useful information such as (i) the amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses; (ii) the provenance of an NFT; (iii) aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc. Data analysis: To reduce lending risks, TRAVA.FINANCE performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA.FINANCE recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, Loan to Value ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA.FINANCE also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools. Credit score evaluation: Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can (i) reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool; and (ii) stimulate borrowing by defining a high Loan to Value ratio for borrowers with high credit scores. Cross-chain identification and cross-chain lending: TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross- chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores. NFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals: To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA.FINANCE allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn considerable amounts from the contract.

Connect with TRAVA.FINANCE', 'Twitter Questions: : The introduction of Trava Station in September 2023 aimed to centralize navigation through the Trava Ecosystem. How has this feature impacted user engagement and interaction with the various products and services offered by Trava Finance, and what metrics highlight its success? Mr. Minh Nguyen: Firstly, let’s talk about the impact of Trava Station on user engagement and interaction. Station serves as a connecting center, providing short ways for users to create transactions on Trava products such as lending pools, staking vaults, governance vault, etc. Therefore, users no longer need to waste time doing multiple steps in a pool/ vault, instead, just do everything quickly at Trava Station. As I typed above, the Station is one of two ways to interact with Trava Dapp in the future (and TravaGPT is the second way). Moreover, Trava Station also provides many useful services to elevate users experience: * Trava Freight: Allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands. * Trava Junction: Allow users to pre-set transactions to be auto-executed when the conditions are met. * Portfolio: A real-time report that keeps track of all your activities and assets in Trava Station. * For the Portfolio, we will cooperate with Centic.io to exploit on-chain data and even off-chain data. * Analytics and Recommendations: Get real-time analysis and personal suggestions based on your assets and preferences to help your decision-making. With these features, Trava Station makes it easy and efficient for users to interact with Trava’s products, driving deeper engagement with Trava Finance. With the first interaction way (I mean Trava Station), the users do not need to know much about the complex of Blockchain, lending, and dex…. but they still can do a lot of things with our Station. They still have much more control and power to cook their Defi recipes if they want or let them automatically based on AI. Secondly, regarding the success of Trava Station, our recent performance report showed that most of the transactions created on Trava Finance come from the Station. This highlights the strong support and positive reception from our users for this product. : What will the future of Trava Finance’s AI Chatbot — Trava GPT be like? Will there be any new features or updates? Mr. Minh Nguyen: This year we focus mainly on AI, hence, we are trying to bring more features based on AI. And at present, for the AI Chatbot — we have TRAVAGPT. With the product, we are implementing a Telegram bot that enables users to chat on Telegram but can interact with the lending pool of Trava. I think this is a unique feature. There are no chatbot solutions can do that right now. Besides, we are also integrating gathering blockchain news feature to the Telegram chat bot. It means, if you add the bot to your Telegram, we can get the summarized news on blockchain market in the form of short new on your chat everyday. With the news, we also provide some analyses and point out the investment opportunities. You can thus make the Defi actions (borrow, lend, repay, swap, …) on Telegram Windows chat directly. Imagine, you can through chat windows do everything with Defi. This is our vision, plan, and roadmap for the year of AI 2024! Please try our TravaGPT: https://app.trava.finance/gpt : Trava Finance’s Bug Bounty program offers valuable rewards for identifying issues related to UI, logical flow, and security. How does this initiative align with Trava’s commitment to platform improvement, and what steps are being taken to ensure that feedback from this program is effectively incorporated into future updates? Mr. Thang Nguyen: Yeah, that’s a great question. As you know, Trava has a huge ecosystem with a wide range of applications. We have a lending marketplace, Trava GPT, NFT, Station, and analytics, …. All of them are complex and have a high level of technical. It took a long time for each development step and ensure the quality of products. And yeah, after the initial development, this Bug Bounty is a way for us to commit to sustainable development, and decentralization, and ensure the quality of products. As the Trava team keeps updating the products with new features and cutting-edge technologies, thorough testing and inspection are crucial to ensure true quality and bring the best experience to our Users. There’s no better way to achieve this than wide-scale public testing; thus, we hold a Bug Bounty Program, inviting everyone to help identify any problems with Trava products. In this way, the decentralization is enhanced, allowing users to contribute to product development. In the future, as Minh shares our vision, a lot of features will be released to complete our ecosystem, and the bug bounty will be one of the important parts of the development plan. To ensure the quality of the feedback in this program, we provide detailed information with clear RULES, NOTES & DISCLAIMER. 👉 Please check them HERE and follow them exactly. Discuss the Present Product of Trava First Question: Currently, Trava has updated and introduced many new features. To make it easier for users to navigate through our products, could you give us a short overview of Trava Finance, please Mr. Minh? Mr. Minh Nguyen: Let’s define Trava again: Trava Finance is an AI-driven Lending Station. The meaning of Station is “a gateway for users to connect and use any lending pools” . Starting with the lending and staking section, now we’ve developed it with many utilities. Currently, Trava Finance has 5 main products: 1️⃣ Trava Lending Market : A marketplace protocol for cross-chain lending. Our lending system combines the Trava lending pool and user-owned pools, offering users opportunities to deposit, borrow assets, or create and manage their pools. 2️⃣ Trava Staking : A staking protocol to deposit $TRAVA, $rTRAVA or $BNB to earn interest. 3️⃣ Trava Governance: A system of DAO (decentralized automated organization). It empowers users to govern Trava Finance by providing them with decision-making power. 4️⃣ Trava Station : A hub that brings together the short ways to use all Trava products, helping users to have a seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. 5️⃣ TravaGPT : An AI chatbot letting users ask for Web3 information and perform various DeFi actions in simple daily conversations. We’ll continue to update Trava with the latest trending technology, so stay tuned with us for upcoming developments! Second Question: Trava has just launched a Bug Bounty Program, which may seem a little bit mechanical and require IT knowledge. To make the game easier, could you give some suggestions for the community, Mr. Thang? Mr. Thang Nguyen: People always think Bug Bounty is a difficult game, however, in Trava Finance version, it’s actually just a piece of cake. Because the objective of this Bug Bounty is to invite the community to join a hand in strengthening Trava Finance, the program is set with straightforward rules: 🗡 If you find any bugs related to the User interface (UI), Logical Flow, and Security, please let us know with a detailed description 🗡. The bug can be realized easily by anyone, even non-IT people. To make it easier for you to understand, let’s go through some examples of each bug type: ➡️ User interface (UI): * Broken or Misaligned Buttons: Buttons are not properly aligned or are overlapping with other elements, making them difficult to click or use. * Invisible Text: Text is the same color as the background, making it impossible to read. * Elements Not Scaling Properly on Different Devices: The design does not adapt to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile vs. desktop — Macos, Windows, …), causing elements to look distorted or disappear. … ➡️ Logical Flow: * Incorrect Calculation Results: The app performs incorrect calculations or logic processing. * Incorrect Date or Time Logic: The countdown system of the vault is wrong or the scheduling system allows users to choose the date/time in the past. … ➡️ Security Issue * Insufficient Authorization Checks: The app does not properly check user permissions, allowing users to access or perform actions they shouldn’t be able to. * Smart contract vulnerability. There are a lot of cases of the issues that can be found on the bug bounty program, although our quality assurance is working hard. Third Question: Now let’s recap what has Trava achieved so far in 2024 before moving on. Please Mr. Minh, do you have anything to share? Mr. Minh Nguyen: Yes, the overview roadmap, I have just mentioned above, now we have the concrete plan. By August 2024, Trava has witnessed strong growth in product development and active community campaigns. In terms of Trava products, we’ve introduced some outstanding features and updates: * Trava Station has been completed: Routes for most actions in tramlines, token transferring in Freight, History & Manage sections, and auto swap in Junction, analysis in Recommendation. * The beginning of 2024 marked the initiation of TravaGPT. Over half of the year, it has grown rapidly to V3.0, supporting both Web3 questions and DeFi actions on Trava Finance. Here you can see the news summarization. * autoCompound Staking was launched to help automate the process of re-staking your rewards from Trava Vault for compound benefits. Regarding community campaigns, Trava successfully attracted many participants in prominent events: * TravaGPT V3.0’s Incentive Campaign kicked off with greater rewards than ever. * The Thread Contest has attracted an impressive number of participants. * Successful programs in the partnership with Centic: -> Referral Event -> Reputation Showcase I think we have many things to share, and discuss around the features and event! Information about Upcoming Activities and Product Releases Fourth Question: 2024 still has 1/3 left. So will Trava round out the year with exciting new product launches, Mr. Thang? Mr. Thang Nguyen: Yeah sure, Our team is always delivering new things. We have a good team in terms of research and product development. It will not be only on BNB Chain and Ethereum but also on other ecosystems, like Arbitrum, or TON, maybe. Let’s wait for the next big thing, very promising! Fifth Question: Could you provide more details about the future development of TravaGPT? Trava is placing a strong emphasis on this product, Please Mr. Minh. Mr. Minh Nguyen: TravaGPT is on the way for massive updates! It’s the main target of us now. By the end of this year, we’ll be launching a Telegram version of TravaGPT, offering users real-time support anytime, anywhere. This will make TravaGPT even more accessible and responsive. In the far future, we expect to enhance the intelligence of TravaGPT, allowing it to give precise recommendations and predictions for each user. Of course, news summarization is also another important feature of TravaGPT in the next months. As I said, TravaGPT is one of the two ways to interact with Trava Dapp in the near future! Sixth Question: What about marketing and media activities? Do you have any plans for the rest of 2024? Mr. Thang Nguyen: Well, Trava is on track for marketing initiatives in the 3rd and 4th quarters of this year. We’re excited to roll out various programs through KOLs, reputable media, and targeted advertising. Here’s what’s coming: * KOLs: We’re partnering with key opinion leaders in the crypto space to introduce Trava to a broader audience and educate the community about the project * Media Coverage: We’ll feature Trava in leading cryptocurrency and investment publications to increase visibility and credibility. * Advertising Campaigns: We’re launching campaigns on platforms like Telegram, Twitter, Discord, and YouTube to reach new users and investors * Special Events: Stay tuned for airdrops, contests, and more exciting community engagement activities!

As mentioned in our recent article and AMA, TOD will play a very important role in the future of Trava Capital. Our new model is expected to provide more features to enhance decentralized market-making strategies on Web3, aiming for success in the dynamic DeFi space. Therefore, getting a good TVL number with TOD Vault this time and then listing the TRAVA/TOD token pair will be a perfect launching pad for Trava Capital's next steps. We want to hear more on the community's opinions Raise your voice here ️ Trava Administration 26 Mar 2024, 21:00 * Actions to take facing the Fantom situation posted in Lending 1. Idea Recently, Fantom – one of the networks where Trava Finance deployed its lending system – encountered serious problems. In such a situation, every step must be carefully calculated to ensure the safety of our ecosystem, particularly the users. And as a DeFi platform, Trava Team always wants to listen and incorporate community opinions into each of our decisions. 2. Approach Fantom is a high-speed blockchain platform, one of the largest in the cryptocurrency world with a wide range of influence, making its demise even more damaging. In just the first half of 2023, it has suffered countless blows to its core, leading to a terrible decline of its native token FTM. You can get more detailed information in this analysis of the situation on our blog HERE. In this situation, although we have urgently suspended our lending pool on Fantom, Trava Finance still needs to consider the next steps to protect the community. So, after discussion, Trava Team has come up with some ideas as follows: * Keep patience and give the Fantom situation time to resolve itself — waiting for the recovery of the ecosystem of DeFi products on Fantom. Besides the bad news, there are obviously some additional things to consider. For example, the Fantom Foundation has announced that it is working on a new cross-chain bridge that will be more secure than Multichain. Its community is still also active with a number of projects being developed, suggesting that some investors are still optimistic about its future. * Develop new features corresponding to Fantom's situation. To face the ongoing problems, Trava Finance has also thought about possibly developing technologies to overcome the challenge. It can lay the foundation for us to deal with similar situations in the future. However, this option faces a huge weakness which is the lack of immediacy, which could mean missing out on the golden time for future development. * Find another ecosystem rather than Fantom, moving there and creating a more resilient community. Although Fantom is strong, it is not the only one in the crypto world. There is no shortage of similar communities, perhaps even larger, to replace Fantom. Lately, there have also been many small but full of potential groups appearing on the market, promising a bright future. We have various options to target and make contact with such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, … 3. Discussion So the question here is how do you think we should choose? If you have another opinion believed to be more reasonable, don't hesitate to speak out. We will carefully review everything to reach a final best decision. Raise your thoughts now to build up our ecosystem together! Trava Administration 14 Sept 2023, 21:00 * Idea Contest for Trava Station posted in Lending 1.

Idea As announced recently, we are preparing to launch the Trava Station. Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. 2. Information Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, Freight is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes Smart Wallet , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the main interface of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don’t have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA. With Trava Freight, all those laborious, time-consuming and costly steps can be combined into a single transaction. In the current version, the scope of implementation with Freight in particular and Trava Station in general is still quite limited, mainly focusing on Lending Pool, Marketplaces, users' wallets… The actions include borrowing, returning assets, adding liquidity or withdrawing, executing conversion orders, buying or selling NFTs, tokens or other digital assets. Of course, we will develop the platform further, add more activities and features in the future, so that everyone has a truly seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. Portfolio is where you can keep track of your position and all your assets in Smart Wallet in Trava Station. Tramlines and Junction are complementary features to Freight, in which Tramlines provide a list of pre-made sequences with arranged actions for you to import. Meanwhile, Junction consists of sequences that are not executed when you create, but are made active by a system bot only when a condition is reached. * For example, you can create a set of actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price reaches $1000 — so when this threshold appears, our system bot will execute the pre-arranged actions. 3. Ask After reading the above information, you may have understood a little more about Trava Station and our vision, right? We treasure all your opinions, because you are who Trava Station was built to serve. So let us know what you think about this upcoming product, suggesting for further development!! And look forward to the launch of Trava Station on August 24, 2023 .

Restructure the main page of Trava, removing the mountains with links to make it seem more user-friendly and easier to understand Trava's focus. 3. Expand to other chains and add new ones, since BNB is in a potentially risky position. 4. Add more DeFi protocols to BRicher, regularly updating good protocols and removing unsafe ones. 5. Simplify the parameters in Lending Pools and add more tokens. Add a type of notification so people would know when liquidations are close. 6. Increase the utility of TRAVA tokens by adding continuous token burn feature, periodically burning minted TRAVA. Allow them to be exchanged on all chains in Trava Lending. 7. Reopen BNB/Trava safety passbook. 8. Launch Knights leasing feature. 9. Do Idea Contest more periodically. 10. Start marketing on Crew3. Motivation: Each of the ideas has been thoroughly researched by us, evaluated for their potential and feasibility.

This discussion is open in order to be able to involve the whole community in contributing to the development of Trava Finance. It’s expected to be a stepping stone before starting the voting snapshot, for everyone to dive deeper into these ideas and voice their own comments. From there, it is also possible for you to pick the best choices for the development of Trava, choosing a worthy winner (or winners).

Idea As announced recently, we are preparing to launch the Trava Station. Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. 2. Information Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, Freight is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes Smart Wallet , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the main interface of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don’t have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA. With Trava Freight, all those laborious, time-consuming and costly steps can be combined into a single transaction. In the current version, the scope of implementation with Freight in particular and Trava Station in general is still quite limited, mainly focusing on Lending Pool, Marketplaces, users\' wallets… The actions include borrowing, returning assets, adding liquidity or withdrawing, executing conversion orders, buying or selling NFTs, tokens or other digital assets. Of course, we will develop the platform further, add more activities and features in the future, so that everyone has a truly seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. Portfolio is where you can keep track of your position and all your assets in Smart Wallet in Trava Station. Tramlines and Junction are complementary features to Freight, in which Tramlines provide a list of pre-made sequences with arranged actions for you to import. Meanwhile, Junction consists of sequences that are not executed when you create, but are made active by a system bot only when a condition is reached. * For example, you can create a set of actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price reaches $1000 — so when this threshold appears, our system bot will execute the pre-arranged actions. 3. Ask After reading the above information, you may have understood a little more about Trava Station and our vision, right? We treasure all your opinions, because you are who Trava Station was built to serve. So let us know what you think about this upcoming product, suggesting for further development!!

We should get away from it completely and just stick with USDC and Tether for now. BNB: Due to global regulators attacking CZ which is BNB really, we should be cautious and begin expanding to more chains quickly in case anything happens to BNB. I feel if BNB goes down Trava is done for since most of its utility is on that chain. That's a huge risk that the team cannot control that has nothing to do with Trava and its investors so we should protect accordingly and diversify. @jefe811 said in IdeaContest--Lending Pool-Trava Knight-Trava Capital: Adding more new chains. Having BNB, ETH, and FTM is great. But, more are needed. Maybe we could put out voting for this issue and which ones to choose. The other issue is most Trava features are just for the BNB chain. ETH and FTM chain users should have all the same feature use as BNB. If they did I feel the TVL on these chains would increase drastically. Agree, there will be pulsechain, fork eth 2.0 much cheaper and faster than eth or polygon matic, and cosmos are cheap aswell and fast, matic is strong project @jefe811 said in IdeaContest--Lending Pool-Trava Knight-Trava Capital: Trava Capital: Trava capital needs a lot of help. It is impossible to understand what money in reserves is actually there. Also what is the actual token circulation count? Coinmarketcap and Coingecko need updates on the token since the price is not tracked anymore. No way for investors to know what the value per token is based off of reserve assets. There should be a visually easy view of token reserves or investments along with their daily market price then divided amongst the circulation we now all know the value per token. I feel a team is needed just for this protocol and if there is one and that's all they do, then we need more folks. We also need more communication. My biggest fear for Trava capital it seems to be a blatant or obvious security or stock share the way it is designed now. Being from the USA I may not be allowed to trade these in the future unfortunately. Thats point, Team should not, skip this kinda situation, its looks bad on view, when tokens is just non tracked. Also we dont know how money left for investing, etc We need more partnership with project, some ama with other group/teams for marketing trava capital and trava token. @jefe811 said in IdeaContest--Lending Pool-Trava Knight-Trava Capital: Trava should use some of the transaction fees earned to complete monthly or quarterly burn of the original amount of minted Trava. This should stay in place permanently. This will only make the price of Trava more valuable. Thats not bad idea, for price token, but honestly i prefer keep money for marketing with others project/people ama's partnerships etc, in social media is silent, i had proposal fore crew 3 but aswell is silent about this idea, we dont have much retweets/likes on tt page compare for followers, dunno why.

How does TRAVA.FINANCE incentivize validators to update the knowledge graph?,0.8571,True,"['Validators must update the knowledge graph regularly, otherwise, they will be stripped of their validator role, and cannot earn rewards for appending new blocks or verifying transactions.” “Each time enriching the knowledge graph, validators will gain the fame score, thereby gaining more priorities and indirectly having the opportunity to earn more TRAVA.FINANCE coins when joining the network.” “Priorities may include voting power or the privilege to unlock TRAVA.FINANCE tokens earlier than the standard time when receiving awards. ']","['Figure 4: Cross-chain identification: The cross-chain identification protocol plays an important role in the TRAVA.FINANCE architecture. It can be used to verify that multiple addresses on different chains belong to the same user. The protocol allows TRAVA.FINANCE to provide an overview of anonymous users, including their total cryptos and other digital assets, statistics for their transactions, and their relationships with other blockchain addresses. These types of information and relationships are stored on the cross-chain knowledge graph. The protocol can (i) improve the credit score of the users and their wallet address so that they can get favorable interest rates, (ii) save them transaction fees since they can use up all of their cryptos as collateral in a single transaction, and (iii) allow them to get their cryptos back when they lose one of their wallet address. To implement the protocol, we develop a wallet application so that users can manage their accounts and prove their ownership of multiple accounts. The application provides users with two functionalities: “Add account” and “Create a proof of ownership”. Users can add a new account to the wallet application in multiple ways, e.g., (i) create an account, (ii) import a private key, and (iii) connect to a hardware wallet. To foster their DeFi transactions, they might need to prove that they are the owner of n addresses. To this end, they can use our wallet application to perform a transaction that activates the cross-chain identification protocol. Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators check the accuracy of the data associated with the transaction. If the data is valid, the validators accept the transaction and write the sameAs relationship among the owners of the addresses to the knowledge graph. In the following we describe our processing to verify the cross-chain identification of multiple wallet addresses.', 'Validator side: Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators verify the timestamp and then verify the signatures as follows. They first extract the message {data1, … datan} and the list of signatures {s1, … sn} . From each data element datai , the validators get the chainId and the public key (i.e., pubi ). They use the Merkle tree to hash the data and regenerate the rootHash : * rootHash := MerkleTree([data1, data2, data3]).getRoot() The validators then use pubi to verify signature si on the rootHash: * verifySignature(rootHash, s1 , pub1) => valid/invalid * verifySignature(rootHash, s2 , pub1) => valid/invalid * verifySignature(rootHash, s3 , pub1) => valid/invalid Once all signatures are valid, the validators agree that all accounts stored in the message belong to the same user. From n pairs of chainId and public key , the validators calculate the respective addresses of the user. To eliminate useless addresses, the validators perform additional checks on the age of the address, its average balance, or the total number of transactions related to the address. Finally, the validators store the sameAs relationship among the valid addresses of the user on the knowledge graph.

Total asset: represents the financial strength of the address. 2. Transaction history: TRAVA aggregates all transactions of a wallet address across all platforms to calculate various parameters such as (i) transaction amount, (ii) number of liquidations, etc. 3. Loans ratio: represents the debt position of an account, including the Loan-to-balance ratio and Loan-to-investment ratio. 4. Circulating asset: represents how active users are in the crypto market, contains (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE. 5. The last parameter is the trustworthiness of possessing assets. At present, TRAVA evaluates two types of digital assets: (i) token and NFT. Each above parameter is normalized to the range of [0, 1000], using a standardized score function that converts z-scores to the range. The z-score is calculated from the mean and the standard deviation from every corresponding parameter of all accounts.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

Connect with TRAVA.FINANCE', '2024 Overview of Trava Finance Ecosystem: Published in 5 min readAug 28, 2024 Share In the ever-growing process, Trava has introduced many new products and updates in 2024, such as TravaGPT, Trava Station, etc. To help you easily navigate through our current ecosystem, we provide a detailed overview of Trava Finance in 2024. The overview of Trava ecosystem At present, Trava Finance aims to become an AI-driven Lending Station that provides cross-chain lending pools and other financial services, empowered by AI technology and automation. With that being said, we want to bring users the most convenience in the DeFi space and complete decentralization in Web3. Currently, there are 6 major products in Trava Finance: 1️⃣ TravaGPT : An AI chatbot of Trava. 2️⃣ Trava Station : A hub that brings together the short ways to use all Trava products. 3️⃣ Smart Wallet: an advanced crypto wallet for Web3 users. 4️⃣ Trava Lending Market : A marketplace protocol providing user-owned lending pools. 5️⃣ Trava Staking : A staking protocol to deposit $TRAVA, $rTRAVA or $BNB to earn interest. 6️⃣ Trava Governance : A governance system, allowing users to vote for major decisions of Trava. Let’s dive into our ecosystem in this article! TravaGPT TravaGPT is an AI chat tool developed by Trava team that helps enhance user experience and navigate our DeFi products more easily. After a process of development, TravaGPT has reached version 3.0 , incorporating more powerful functions than a mere chatbot. With TravaGPT, you just need to tell it what you want to know or to do, it will provide you not only useful information but also complete the actions for you. Currently, it has 3 major features: 1️⃣ Ask anything in Web3 2️⃣ Talk anywhere on Trava 3️⃣ Support DeFi actions in pools or vaults on Trava Finance Feature highlights of TravaGPT TravaGPT will soon be available on Telegram, a popular platform among Web3 enthusiasts. By expanding to Telegram, we aim to offer users a more convenient way to access TravaGPT and a more user-friendly interface. Trava Station Trava Station serves as a center of Trava Finance, aiming to help users in the Trava ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving them time and money when making transactions. With Trava Station, instead of having to move between dApps and platforms to perform actions, you can combine them all together in one transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time and gas costs compared to when doing separate actions. Let’s see how you can aggregate multiple actions in one transaction and how much gas fees you can save in the picture below. Save more with Trava Station At present, Trava Station has 6 features: ➡️ Freight : Allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands. ➡️ Tramlines : Provides a list of pre-made shortcuts to do common actions. ➡️ Junction : Allow users to pre-set transactions to be auto-executed when the conditions are met. ➡️ Portfolio : A real-time report that keeps track of all your activities and assets in Trava Station. ➡️ Analytics : Get real-time analysis of the market as well as user preference in Trava Finance. ➡️ Recommendations : Provide a thorough analysis and prediction of DEXs’ parameters. Smart Wallet Smart Wallet is an advanced digital tool that relies on smart contracts, which are only created and owned by the user. Setting apart from other normal wallets, it eliminates the need for private keys or seed phrases. Using a smart wallet offers more advantages for users: * Save fees and streamline transaction process : They enable a smoother DeFi experience by combining multiple transactions into one, reducing transaction fees. * Enhanced user experience and privacy : Smart Wallets offer convenience while improving security, appealing to both new and experienced users by utilizing smart contracts to reduce dependence on private keys. * Additional features and security : Smart Wallets can support multi-signature transactions, add extra layers of security through app authentication, limit daily transaction amounts, and prevent potential errors or theft. Smart Wallet is incorporated in Trava Station and TravaGPT to optimize DeFi actions for users in Trava Finance. Specifically, with Trava Station, your assets are temporarily moved to a Smart Wallet to execute all your actions in a single transaction, making the process smoother. After the actions are completed, your assets are returned to your main wallet (like Metamask or Trust Wallet). To have your own Smart Wallet, you just need to connect your wallet to Trava Finance and go to the Freight tab of Trava Station to create it. Trava Lending Market This is the first lending market that allows users to not only deposit, and borrow assets, but also create and manage their own lending pools. Trava lending system consists of the Trava lending pool and 7 user-owned pools. Trava pool supports around 10 types of assets across 2 different blockchains ( BSC and Ethereum ), while the user-owned pools offer limitless possibilities based on user creativity and specific needs. The lending pools on Trava Lending Market Trava Staking This is a staking protocol that allows users to deposit Trava Finance’s tokens ($TRAVA/ $rTRAVA) and BNB Chain’s token ($BNB). Users will then receive corresponding rewards based on their deposit and annual percentage rate (APR) of the staking vaults. Currently, there are three available vaults in Trava Staking which are shown in the picture below. The available staking vaults of Trava Finance Trava Governance Trava Finance also aims to apply the DAO model to the entire system with , which allows users to propose and vote on changes to the ecosystem.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1 In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc. In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including: Discussion == > Proposal ==> Voting off-chain on the Snapshot ==> Voting on-chain ==> Execution In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: The amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time. Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features: * Democracy * Connectivity * Up-to-date The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2 In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process. Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.

Home: Categories Categories *', ': Formula to calculate Farming rewards How to calculate the rewards for Copper, Silver and Gold Vaults? Each vault has a value called emissionPerSecond . This is a fixed amount that all depositors will be rewarded when they deposit NFT per second. Therefore, the fewer number of people staking NFT, the more rewards each staker will get. How to calculate the rewards for Diamond and Crystal Vaults? The Glossiness of each NFT starts off at 100%, but it gradually decreases over time, affecting the incentives received when users deposit their NFTs in the vault. Users must complete ""Polishing"" acts in order to receive 100% of the rewards. The amount of reward from NFT polishing shall be calculated using 2 parameters: decayRate and decayInterval . Concretely, after a decayInterval (a certain amount of time), if the NFT is not polished, the rewards for the next decayInterval will be reduced ( decayRate , calculated in % will decrease) For example: decayInterval = 2 days and decayRate = 10% indicates that: every two days without polishing, the rewards of the next day will be reduced (due to the NFT glossiness). Hence, after 20 days, the amount of rewards for NFT will be 0.

Each vault has a value called emissionPerSecond . This is a fixed amount that all depositors will be rewarded when they deposit NFT per second. Therefore, the fewer number of people staking NFT, the more rewards each staker will get. How to calculate the rewards for Diamond and Crystal Vaults? The Glossiness of each NFT starts off at 100%, but it gradually decreases over time, affecting the incentives received when users deposit their NFTs in the vault. Users must complete ""Polishing"" acts in order to receive 100% of the rewards. The amount of reward from NFT polishing shall be calculated using 2 parameters: decayRate and decayInterval . Concretely, after a decayInterval (a certain amount of time), if the NFT is not polished, the rewards for the next decayInterval will be reduced ( decayRate , calculated in % will decrease) For example: decayInterval = 2 days and decayRate = 10% indicates that: every two days without polishing, the rewards of the next day will be reduced (due to the NFT glossiness). Hence, after 20 days, the amount of rewards for NFT will be 0. If you stake NFT for a period t = 9, the amount of incentives that you probably get is 450 Trava (On average per day you will get 450/9 = 50). However, you have forgotten to polish for 9 days.

How has this feature impacted user engagement and interaction with the various products and services offered by Trava Finance, and what metrics highlight its success? Mr. Minh Nguyen: Firstly, let’s talk about the impact of Trava Station on user engagement and interaction. Station serves as a connecting center, providing short ways for users to create transactions on Trava products such as lending pools, staking vaults, governance vault, etc. Therefore, users no longer need to waste time doing multiple steps in a pool/ vault, instead, just do everything quickly at Trava Station. As I typed above, the Station is one of two ways to interact with Trava Dapp in the future (and TravaGPT is the second way). Moreover, Trava Station also provides many useful services to elevate users experience: * Trava Freight: Allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands. * Trava Junction: Allow users to pre-set transactions to be auto-executed when the conditions are met. * Portfolio: A real-time report that keeps track of all your activities and assets in Trava Station. * For the Portfolio, we will cooperate with Centic.io to exploit on-chain data and even off-chain data. * Analytics and Recommendations: Get real-time analysis and personal suggestions based on your assets and preferences to help your decision-making. With these features, Trava Station makes it easy and efficient for users to interact with Trava’s products, driving deeper engagement with Trava Finance. With the first interaction way (I mean Trava Station), the users do not need to know much about the complex of Blockchain, lending, and dex…. but they still can do a lot of things with our Station. They still have much more control and power to cook their Defi recipes if they want or let them automatically based on AI. Secondly, regarding the success of Trava Station, our recent performance report showed that most of the transactions created on Trava Finance come from the Station. This highlights the strong support and positive reception from our users for this product. : What will the future of Trava Finance’s AI Chatbot — Trava GPT be like? Will there be any new features or updates? Mr. Minh Nguyen: This year we focus mainly on AI, hence, we are trying to bring more features based on AI. And at present, for the AI Chatbot — we have TRAVAGPT. With the product, we are implementing a Telegram bot that enables users to chat on Telegram but can interact with the lending pool of Trava. I think this is a unique feature. There are no chatbot solutions can do that right now. Besides, we are also integrating gathering blockchain news feature to the Telegram chat bot. It means, if you add the bot to your Telegram, we can get the summarized news on blockchain market in the form of short new on your chat everyday. With the news, we also provide some analyses and point out the investment opportunities. You can thus make the Defi actions (borrow, lend, repay, swap, …) on Telegram Windows chat directly. Imagine, you can through chat windows do everything with Defi. This is our vision, plan, and roadmap for the year of AI 2024! Please try our TravaGPT: https://app.trava.finance/gpt : Trava Finance’s Bug Bounty program offers valuable rewards for identifying issues related to UI, logical flow, and security. How does this initiative align with Trava’s commitment to platform improvement, and what steps are being taken to ensure that feedback from this program is effectively incorporated into future updates? Mr. Thang Nguyen: Yeah, that’s a great question. As you know, Trava has a huge ecosystem with a wide range of applications. We have a lending marketplace, Trava GPT, NFT, Station, and analytics, …. All of them are complex and have a high level of technical. It took a long time for each development step and ensure the quality of products. And yeah, after the initial development, this Bug Bounty is a way for us to commit to sustainable development, and decentralization, and ensure the quality of products. As the Trava team keeps updating the products with new features and cutting-edge technologies, thorough testing and inspection are crucial to ensure true quality and bring the best experience to our Users. There’s no better way to achieve this than wide-scale public testing; thus, we hold a Bug Bounty Program, inviting everyone to help identify any problems with Trava products. In this way, the decentralization is enhanced, allowing users to contribute to product development. In the future, as Minh shares our vision, a lot of features will be released to complete our ecosystem, and the bug bounty will be one of the important parts of the development plan. To ensure the quality of the feedback in this program, we provide detailed information with clear RULES, NOTES & DISCLAIMER. 👉 Please check them HERE and follow them exactly. Discuss the Present Product of Trava First Question: Currently, Trava has updated and introduced many new features. To make it easier for users to navigate through our products, could you give us a short overview of Trava Finance, please Mr. Minh? Mr. Minh Nguyen: Let’s define Trava again: Trava Finance is an AI-driven Lending Station. The meaning of Station is “a gateway for users to connect and use any lending pools” . Starting with the lending and staking section, now we’ve developed it with many utilities. Currently, Trava Finance has 5 main products: 1️⃣ Trava Lending Market : A marketplace protocol for cross-chain lending. Our lending system combines the Trava lending pool and user-owned pools, offering users opportunities to deposit, borrow assets, or create and manage their pools. 2️⃣ Trava Staking : A staking protocol to deposit $TRAVA, $rTRAVA or $BNB to earn interest. 3️⃣ Trava Governance: A system of DAO (decentralized automated organization). It empowers users to govern Trava Finance by providing them with decision-making power. 4️⃣ Trava Station : A hub that brings together the short ways to use all Trava products, helping users to have a seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. 5️⃣ TravaGPT : An AI chatbot letting users ask for Web3 information and perform various DeFi actions in simple daily conversations. We’ll continue to update Trava with the latest trending technology, so stay tuned with us for upcoming developments! Second Question: Trava has just launched a Bug Bounty Program, which may seem a little bit mechanical and require IT knowledge. To make the game easier, could you give some suggestions for the community, Mr. Thang? Mr. Thang Nguyen: People always think Bug Bounty is a difficult game, however, in Trava Finance version, it’s actually just a piece of cake. Because the objective of this Bug Bounty is to invite the community to join a hand in strengthening Trava Finance, the program is set with straightforward rules: 🗡 If you find any bugs related to the User interface (UI), Logical Flow, and Security, please let us know with a detailed description 🗡. The bug can be realized easily by anyone, even non-IT people. To make it easier for you to understand, let’s go through some examples of each bug type: ➡️ User interface (UI): * Broken or Misaligned Buttons: Buttons are not properly aligned or are overlapping with other elements, making them difficult to click or use. * Invisible Text: Text is the same color as the background, making it impossible to read. * Elements Not Scaling Properly on Different Devices: The design does not adapt to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile vs. desktop — Macos, Windows, …), causing elements to look distorted or disappear. … ➡️ Logical Flow: * Incorrect Calculation Results: The app performs incorrect calculations or logic processing. * Incorrect Date or Time Logic: The countdown system of the vault is wrong or the scheduling system allows users to choose the date/time in the past. … ➡️ Security Issue * Insufficient Authorization Checks: The app does not properly check user permissions, allowing users to access or perform actions they shouldn’t be able to. * Smart contract vulnerability. There are a lot of cases of the issues that can be found on the bug bounty program, although our quality assurance is working hard. Third Question: Now let’s recap what has Trava achieved so far in 2024 before moving on. Please Mr. Minh, do you have anything to share? Mr. Minh Nguyen: Yes, the overview roadmap, I have just mentioned above, now we have the concrete plan. By August 2024, Trava has witnessed strong growth in product development and active community campaigns. In terms of Trava products, we’ve introduced some outstanding features and updates: * Trava Station has been completed: Routes for most actions in tramlines, token transferring in Freight, History & Manage sections, and auto swap in Junction, analysis in Recommendation. * The beginning of 2024 marked the initiation of TravaGPT. Over half of the year, it has grown rapidly to V3.0, supporting both Web3 questions and DeFi actions on Trava Finance. Here you can see the news summarization. * autoCompound Staking was launched to help automate the process of re-staking your rewards from Trava Vault for compound benefits. Regarding community campaigns, Trava successfully attracted many participants in prominent events: * TravaGPT V3.0’s Incentive Campaign kicked off with greater rewards than ever. * The Thread Contest has attracted an impressive number of participants. * Successful programs in the partnership with Centic: -> Referral Event -> Reputation Showcase I think we have many things to share, and discuss around the features and event! Information about Upcoming Activities and Product Releases Fourth Question: 2024 still has 1/3 left. So will Trava round out the year with exciting new product launches, Mr. Thang? Mr. Thang Nguyen: Yeah sure, Our team is always delivering new things. We have a good team in terms of research and product development. It will not be only on BNB Chain and Ethereum but also on other ecosystems, like Arbitrum, or TON, maybe. Let’s wait for the next big thing, very promising! Fifth Question: Could you provide more details about the future development of TravaGPT? Trava is placing a strong emphasis on this product, Please Mr. Minh. Mr. Minh Nguyen: TravaGPT is on the way for massive updates! It’s the main target of us now. By the end of this year, we’ll be launching a Telegram version of TravaGPT, offering users real-time support anytime, anywhere. This will make TravaGPT even more accessible and responsive. In the far future, we expect to enhance the intelligence of TravaGPT, allowing it to give precise recommendations and predictions for each user. Of course, news summarization is also another important feature of TravaGPT in the next months. As I said, TravaGPT is one of the two ways to interact with Trava Dapp in the near future! Sixth Question: What about marketing and media activities? Do you have any plans for the rest of 2024?

This new product marks another step in the evolution of Trava Finance, closer to fulfilling our goal of a convenient and seamless DeFi environment. The first Testnet version of Trava Station comes with two features: Freight and Portfolio. After testing and collecting user opinions, Tramlines and Junction will be added, preparing for the release on Mainnet. Trava Station is live on Testnet You can continue with the content below to understand more about Trava Station and the 2 features that have been launched. We’ll also go over the benefits of Trava Station again, providing a few small examples of the fee difference between using Trava Station and not. Check out Trava Station here: https://app.trava.finance/station Freight As in the published content, this is a feature that allows users to combine many actions in the Trava Finance ecosystem into a single transaction. Trava Freight allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands, with simple options like drag and drop, click… to put actions into a route. After that, you just need to fill in the corresponding necessary parameters and you’re done, for example as shown in the image below. Currently in this Testnet version, Freight allows basic actions and interactions with Trava Finance’s Lending Pools, BNB chain… We are still continuing to polish the product, adding more actions related to NFT and launching together in the Mainnet version. Of course, we won’t stop just there, but will develop Freight even more in the future. So if you have any suggestion, say it so we Trava team can check and maybe work on them. Portfolio In order for Trava Station and its features to work smoothly, we integrated Smart Wallet in our system, with more detailed information can be found in our previous article. You will be asked to create a Smart Wallet the first time joining Trava Station, and it will act as an intermediary for all your actions, temporarily holding your assets. To make it easier for you to track Smart Wallet position and assets, we have added the Portfolio feature. This feature will display your position in the Lending Pool when you use Smart Wallet to perform actions in the pools in the Trava ecosystem. Or if you create an order to sell Armoury items, Portfolio will display those NFTs for sale, and the amount of money you have in your Smart Wallet from the sale. With more actions and features added in the future, the Portfolio page will also show more user information and details related to the Station. Upcoming features As mentioned in the product ideas overview in our Forum, Trava Station has a total of 4 main features in plan. In addition to the two mentioned above will be in this Testnet version, we also intend to bring Tramlines and Junction in the future. * Among them, the former is a collection of pre-made routes with actions that are commonly used. We will soon make an announcement on consulting users about Tramlines, so stay tuned to not miss it. * Meanwhile, the Junction feature is for routes that work in the future — they won’t run when created like with Freight. You can specify one or some conditions, and a system bot will monitor them and execute them when the parameters are reached. For example, you can set actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price gets to $1000 — this threshold appearing will signal our system bot to execute the pre-arranged actions. The benefits Trava Station is intended to reduce both the time you spend switching between Trava platforms, and the fee of making multiple transactions. Normally, to accomplish a certain goal such as staking into Trava Finance’s Vault, you will have to supply, swap and stake in turn. It seems easy with just a few actions, but there can be times when the goal requires up to a dozen, each happening on different platforms, wasting you a lot of precious time. That’s not to mention the amount of fees you have to pay to perform separate transactions — because usually you cannot execute another action if you have a pending one. But now with Trava Station, things will become much simpler and more economical, when various actions can be combined into a single transaction. The fee difference Here are a few example actions to show the difference between the fee you will spend using Trava Station versus not using it: * 2 actions: If you perform repay (token DAI) and withdraw (token AAVE) in Trava Station, the cost will be 0.001530189 BNB — 10.83% less than the normal gas fee of 0.001716111 BNB. * 3 actions: If you supply (USDC token), borrow (TRAVA token) and then withdraw (AAVE token), the savings will be nearly 18% — down from 0.002695095 to 0.002210151 (BNB). * 4 actions: With actions like supply (USDC token), borrow (TRAVA token), repay (DAI token) and withdraw (AAVE token), normally the gas fee will be 0.003372765 BNB. But with Trava Station, it will decrease to 0.002767023 BNB — 17.96%. NOTE ‼️ All the above parameters are just examples at the time we test the product, there will be fluctuations when users actually use it. Conclusion Overall, Trava Station is only in Testnet now and has a long way to go. We will constantly continue to modify and add more features to further develop this product, finally releasing it on Mainnet. In our vision, Trava Station is hoped to become the transit point of convenience for our community. From the very beginning, the goal of Trava Finance has always been to create a seamless and easy DeFi environment for users — we will not stop on the way there. 🌟So let’s check out Trava Station here: https://app.trava.finance/station ** About Trava.Finance Trava Finance is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending.** While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, Trava Finance offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.

But there is still a lot to do on the journey of becoming a Decentralized Lending Marketplace waiting ahead, especially with the rapid development of technology today. To give Trava Knights a thorough look into the future plan of Trava Finance for 2024, we have created this Roadmap. The Final Quarter of 2023 In the fourth quarter of 2023, Trava Finance had plans to release Tramlines for Trava Station , and already successfully executed it. This feature offers various preset Routes of most common actions in the Trava ecosystem, enabling users to perform investment strategies much faster and easier. Our next addition is Web3 Portfolio , which will allow users to have full control over their current DeFi assets and lending position. This feature can be said to be an upgraded and consolidated version of our dApps, giving users a unified view of their portfolio, making it easier to track and manage their investments. We will also introduce Lending Analytics — it will provide powerful views for users about lending protocols on the market, including finance and user aspects. This feature allows you to track your lending position, performance, and other data, giving detailed insights into lending activities of end users to help empower our AI model. The First Quarter of 2024 At the beginning of 2024, Trava Team will put a lot of effort into launching Trava Junction , the final feature in Station that allows users to create transactions in advance that only automatically execute when a preset condition(s) is met. We will release Ver. 1 of Junction in the first quarter, with the Monitoring User Position function. Trava Team has also been making preparations from now to launch User Portfolio and Position Alerts — to further enhance user experience. In general, they are two tools that will help you monitor more closely your personal data and lending positions, thereby staying on top of your investment game and making timely decisions. Another crucial milestone in the first Quarter of 2024 will be the release of Lending Recommendation by AI , with the first step being Protocols Suggestion . This is the place where BRicher and Trava Station meet each other — Based on your portfolio, Bricher will recommend the potential and suitable lending actions for users. The Second Quarter of 2024 In the following Quarter, we will be building on the success of our previous releases with some updates. First is Tramlines Suggestion for Trava Station, an addition to Lending Recommendation by AI . With this, a new era of Trava ecosystems will be fully set in, and new opportunities in the community are going to be established. In the same Quarter, we will be introducing Trends Alerts and News Capturing . The former will aggregate all news related to lending pools and provide to our Users. Meanwhile, the latter will alert users when there is anyone on chain trends relevant to lending protocols to users. In the second quarter of 2024, users can also experience Ver. 2 of Trava Junction , now added with Automating User Actions to make user financial experience more seamless and efficient. With this development, our AI-driven system will analyze and evaluate aggregated data, from which to choose and perform the most appropriate actions for you under your permission. The Third Quarter of 2024 For the latter half of the following year, we have planned some exciting new features and updates for our users. In general, Trava Finance will focus quite a bit on upgrading different aspects of Trava Station , especially applying Generative AI in its ecosystem. We will strive to expand the availability of Trava Apps, which will bring users an even more secure, smooth, and exciting experience in DeFi. Trava Team will carry out the Trava Junction for Pool Creation , which gives users more control and flexibility over their investment decisions in the Trava ecosystem. Two other features are more closely related to Tramlines, the former of which is an update of Lending Recommendation with Tramlines creation by AI . The other is Personalized Tramlines by AI , which will provide users with relevant and customized financial recommendations based on their financial history and credit score. The Fourth Quarter of 2024 We have some cutting-edge technology planned for our users to experience in the final quarter of 2024. Our TramlinesGPT and JunctionGPT will be the most direct results of the AI technology developed by Trava Finance. These features will enable conditional interaction between the users and Trava Station, utilizing natural language processing and machine learning to give users the best answers and suggestions. Conclusion The year 2023 has seen some downs, but the important thing is that we continue to grow strongly, and closer to the goal of Decentralized Lending Marketplace. 2024 is predicted to be the year of potential opportunities for Trava Finance and the crypto market, with the content of the Station Roadmap mentioned above.

Utilizing Smart Wallet in Trava Station system However, many people may not understand their fundamental mechanisms and profound benefits, and that is why we have this article. Follow along with the content below to answer questions surrounding Smart Wallet, and clarify the importance of it in the Trava Station system. Unveiling the Smart Wallet At its core, a smart wallet is an advanced digital tool designed to enhance the way we store, manage, and interact with our financial assets. Each smart wallet is created and owned by the user, representing them (their proxy) and ensuring absolute control over its operations. Departing from the standard Web3 wallets, smart wallets eliminate the need for private keys or seed phrases, instead rely on smart contracts. These intricate computer programs run on a blockchain, operate based on predefined rules and conditions. Conditions and access permissions are encoded into these self-executing code, rendering Smart Wallet both secure and adaptable for managing financial resources. Smart Wallet and Trava Station When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create a Smart Wallet.

In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty?: The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated?: In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level.

You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation?: The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals.', 'When do I need to repay the loan?: As long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period.

It means you would be no longer entitled to the potential upside value gain. Whereas, by borrowing, you can still obtain these potential earnings (working capital) without losing your asset. You can borrow when unexpected expenses happen and leverage your holding assets for other investment opportunities. How to borrow?: In order to borrow, you need to deposit any asset to be used as collateral first (check out the Depositing & Earning FAQ section for more info). After depositing, you simply go to the “Borrow” section and click the “Borrow” button on the asset you want to borrow. Input the amount and approve the transaction. The borrowed amount is based on the available deposits that you used as collateral. What is the maximum amount can I borrow?: The maximum amount you can borrow depends on your deposited value and the available liquidity. Please notice the health factor and liquidation threshold indicators to guarantee your collaterals are in the state of safety. Besides, you can not borrow if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor is too low.']","['https://docs.trava.finance/faq/borrowing', 'https://docs.trava.finance/faq/borrowing', 'https://docs.trava.finance/user-guide/lending-pool-user-guide', 'https://docs.trava.finance/user-guide/trava-pool-creation-user-guide', 'https://docs.trava.finance/faq/borrowing']",['https://docs.trava.finance/faq/borrowing']

This new product marks another step in the evolution of Trava Finance, closer to fulfilling our goal of a convenient and seamless DeFi environment. The first Testnet version of Trava Station comes with two features: Freight and Portfolio. After testing and collecting user opinions, Tramlines and Junction will be added, preparing for the release on Mainnet. Trava Station is live on Testnet You can continue with the content below to understand more about Trava Station and the 2 features that have been launched. We’ll also go over the benefits of Trava Station again, providing a few small examples of the fee difference between using Trava Station and not. Check out Trava Station here: https://app.trava.finance/station Freight As in the published content, this is a feature that allows users to combine many actions in the Trava Finance ecosystem into a single transaction. Trava Freight allows users to execute the sequence of actions according to their own demands, with simple options like drag and drop, click… to put actions into a route. After that, you just need to fill in the corresponding necessary parameters and you’re done, for example as shown in the image below. Currently in this Testnet version, Freight allows basic actions and interactions with Trava Finance’s Lending Pools, BNB chain… We are still continuing to polish the product, adding more actions related to NFT and launching together in the Mainnet version. Of course, we won’t stop just there, but will develop Freight even more in the future. So if you have any suggestion, say it so we Trava team can check and maybe work on them. Portfolio In order for Trava Station and its features to work smoothly, we integrated Smart Wallet in our system, with more detailed information can be found in our previous article. You will be asked to create a Smart Wallet the first time joining Trava Station, and it will act as an intermediary for all your actions, temporarily holding your assets. To make it easier for you to track Smart Wallet position and assets, we have added the Portfolio feature. This feature will display your position in the Lending Pool when you use Smart Wallet to perform actions in the pools in the Trava ecosystem. Or if you create an order to sell Armoury items, Portfolio will display those NFTs for sale, and the amount of money you have in your Smart Wallet from the sale. With more actions and features added in the future, the Portfolio page will also show more user information and details related to the Station. Upcoming features As mentioned in the product ideas overview in our Forum, Trava Station has a total of 4 main features in plan. In addition to the two mentioned above will be in this Testnet version, we also intend to bring Tramlines and Junction in the future. * Among them, the former is a collection of pre-made routes with actions that are commonly used. We will soon make an announcement on consulting users about Tramlines, so stay tuned to not miss it. * Meanwhile, the Junction feature is for routes that work in the future — they won’t run when created like with Freight. You can specify one or some conditions, and a system bot will monitor them and execute them when the parameters are reached. For example, you can set actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price gets to $1000 — this threshold appearing will signal our system bot to execute the pre-arranged actions. The benefits Trava Station is intended to reduce both the time you spend switching between Trava platforms, and the fee of making multiple transactions. Normally, to accomplish a certain goal such as staking into Trava Finance’s Vault, you will have to supply, swap and stake in turn. It seems easy with just a few actions, but there can be times when the goal requires up to a dozen, each happening on different platforms, wasting you a lot of precious time. That’s not to mention the amount of fees you have to pay to perform separate transactions — because usually you cannot execute another action if you have a pending one. But now with Trava Station, things will become much simpler and more economical, when various actions can be combined into a single transaction. The fee difference Here are a few example actions to show the difference between the fee you will spend using Trava Station versus not using it: * 2 actions: If you perform repay (token DAI) and withdraw (token AAVE) in Trava Station, the cost will be 0.001530189 BNB — 10.83% less than the normal gas fee of 0.001716111 BNB. * 3 actions: If you supply (USDC token), borrow (TRAVA token) and then withdraw (AAVE token), the savings will be nearly 18% — down from 0.002695095 to 0.002210151 (BNB). * 4 actions: With actions like supply (USDC token), borrow (TRAVA token), repay (DAI token) and withdraw (AAVE token), normally the gas fee will be 0.003372765 BNB. But with Trava Station, it will decrease to 0.002767023 BNB — 17.96%. NOTE ‼️ All the above parameters are just examples at the time we test the product, there will be fluctuations when users actually use it. Conclusion Overall, Trava Station is only in Testnet now and has a long way to go. We will constantly continue to modify and add more features to further develop this product, finally releasing it on Mainnet. In our vision, Trava Station is hoped to become the transit point of convenience for our community. From the very beginning, the goal of Trava Finance has always been to create a seamless and easy DeFi environment for users — we will not stop on the way there. 🌟So let’s check out Trava Station here: https://app.trava.finance/station ** About Trava.Finance Trava Finance is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending.** While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, Trava Finance offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.

Explain in details Trava governace v1 and the vision for version 2,0.9459,True,"['Governance v1  For version 1 of Trava Governance, we present evolution in governance processes with on-chain features enabled. Governance Process  The governance process consists of 2 continuous processes: off-chain & on-chain.      Off-chain process:  In the off-chain process, anyone in the Trava community can raise their opinions and discuss ideas of how the protocol can improve by creating TRC - Trava Request for Comments on the Trava Forum.  After an idea is well-formed, a community member can follow our template for TIP - Trava Improvement Proposal and post on the forum for details feedback. We recommend off-chain voting (powered by snapshot.org) to gain exposure and rough consensus from the community to increase the chance of succeeding in the on-chain process.  When a TIP gets to its final version, the DAO Committee is in charge of the review process and officially proposes on-chain.      On-chain process:  When a TIP is proposed on-chain, it becomes transparent on the public blockchain; anyone possessing voting power can directly vote for or against this proposal.  After the voting period, a TIP will be queued and executed by the public.  The Security Advisory Board acts as a guardian to prevent malicious actions and security exploits in this process. Governance Authority  In governance version 1, the DAO will have authority over the Trava lending protocol. The community will have to agree on any significant changes or updates through the on-chain process. Governance Power  To gain governance power, holders need to lock their Trava or rTrava token in exchange for the veTRAVA token, which holds voting power. This vote locking mechanism encourages users who show a solid commitment to the protocol with more governance power and incentive.', 'In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1  In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc.  In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including:      Discussion: In this stage, Trava holders will discuss different problems on the Trava Forum.     Proposal: On this forum, once a person brings his or her ideas to the platform, the community will determine whether they should be considered by up-voting this proposal. If the community approves, it will be brought on the snapshot in the next step.     Voting off-chain on the snapshot: On the snapshot, users will vote for the proposition they want.     Voting on-chain: After the voting on the snapshot, the whole governance process will then be generated totally on-chain.     Execution: After the stage of making the decision, there are two scenarios. If the proposal is accepted, it will be executed; otherwise, it will be canceled.  In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: the amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time.  Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features:      Democracy: The voting enforcement process is democratic and transparent.     Connectivity: The community members can recommend, discuss, and manage the products and the development direction of the Trava Ecosystem.     Up-to-date: The community members can recommend the latest technologies and features based on the market trend that help the whole system make changes to the protocol for the best result.  The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2  Trava is the first one that allows users to create and manage their own lending pool. In the future, governance will play a significant role in the initialization movements and their operation in the future.  In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process.  Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.']","['1.

By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project. In addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated. In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction.

To fulfill the “decentralized” part of the Trava Decentralized Marketplace, we launched Trava Governance, based on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model, to give users decision-making power. In this case, veTRAVA, in the form of NFT, represents this power and is determined by the time and amount of locked tokens (as they show your commitment toward the future of Trava Finance).  With the implementation of the Trava Governance Vault, users can lock their TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB into this vault to receive a certain amount of veTRAVA representing their powers: the more veTRAVA you own, the higher your voting power in the Trava ecosystem. The Benefits Of Owning veTRAVA  The key value of veTRAVA is its representative of users’ power and their commitment to the project. As a result, in the long term, users who own veTRAVA can receive significant benefits:      Deciding on crucial parameters such as LTV, risk parameters, etc., in the lending pools (Trava Lending Pool and Users-owned Pools).     Receiving share profit coming from the fee charged by borrowers     Receiving boosting rewards in rTRAVA by providing liquidity and holding veTRAVA at the same time.     Earning TRAVA reward: the APR will be revealed soon.  As mentioned, veTRAVA is utilized as a form of NFT. For now, it can only be available for those who lock their token into the Governance Vault. However, it will be exchanged peer-to-peer with the launch of veTRAVA Marketplace. veTRAVA Marketplace: Overview  As its name suggests, the veTRAVA marketplace is for users to buy and sell their veTRAVA. It means they can freely exchange their voting power. The main reason we came up with this idea is to optimize users’ experience, bringing them as much freedom as possible. It’s the “Decentralization” we are heading for.  Besides bringing more freedom to users, veTRAVA Marketplace increases liquidity for veTRAVA and thus benefits both sellers and buyers. In more detail, buyers can buy veTRAVA (voting power) easily on Marketplace and then earn voting power immediately. In this case, the remaining locking time will be more flexible, no longer limited to a particular period set in the Governance Vault. When it comes to sellers, they can easily utilize crypto assets in a more liberal way and get benefits from it. The Influences of veTRAVA Marketplace  veTRAVA Marketplace is an important feature that contributes to the development of Trava Governance. As mentioned above, users who hold many veTRAVA will have a crucial role in the decision-making process of the Trava Finance ecosystem. The veTRAVA holders can alternate the voting results, and through the Marketplace, users can buy or sell the voting power with others.  With the fact that users can trade their voting power to each other, anyone in the ecosystem will have a chance to vote for the changes they want to make in Trava Finance. The more users have veTRAVA, the more voting power is distributed, and users will be given the full power to make the decisions that can affect the Decentralized Lending Marketplace, which will elevate the decentralized side of Trava Finance’s ultimate goal.']","[""V: veTRAVA veTRAVA stands for voting escrow Trava.

What is health factor and how is it calculated exactly?,0.9957,True,"['What is Health factor?  Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation?  The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals.', 'Health Factor  For a wallet, these risk parameters enable the calculation of the health factor: Hf=C1×LT1+⋯+Cn×LTnB Hf\u200b=BC1\u200b×LT1\u200b+⋯+Cn\u200b×LTn\u200b\u200b  where  BB is total borrows (in dollars), C1,…,CnC1\u200b,…,Cn\u200b is  the values (in dollars) of collateral assets, and LT1,…,LTnLT1\u200b,…,LTn\u200b is their liquidation threshold, respectively.

In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty?: The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated?: In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2.

I want to know the details of TRAVA's audit across all auditor platforms.,0.8592,True,"['Audit completion by Certik Audit Scope  The audit focused on the following considerations:      Testing the smart contracts against both common and uncommon attack vectors.      Assessing the codebase to ensure compliance with current best practices and industry standards.      Ensuring contract logic meets the specifications and intentions of the client.      Cross-referencing contract structure and implementation against similar smart contracts produced by industry leaders.      Thorough line-by-line manual review of the entire codebase by industry experts  Findings:  There are seven issues found in total, including 1 Minor Finding, 2 Informational Findings, and 4 Major Findings.  Firstly, one Minor and Two Informational Issues concern some coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused functions, missing zero addresses checking, and function type. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.  Secondly, all four Major Issues are related to Centralization. The owners of the following contracts below can execute some functions without obtaining the consensus of the community:      FactoryRegistry,      AddressesProviderFactory      PoolUpdateControl      LendingPoolConfigurator   Certik Recommendations for the Centralization Issue:  Certik advised to carefully manage the governance/guardian account’s private key to avoid any potential risks of being hacked. In general, Certik strongly recommended centralized privileges or roles in the protocol to be improved via a decentralized mechanism or via smart-contract-based accounts with enhanced security practices, e.g. Multisignature wallets.  Some feasible solutions recommended by Certik that would also mitigate the potential risk include:      Time-lock with reasonable latency, i.e. 48 hours, for awareness on privileged operations;      Assignment of privileged roles to multi-signature wallets to prevent a single point of failure due to the private key;      Introduction of a DAO/governance/voting module to increase transparency and user involvement.  Trava Solutions for the Centralization Issue  Trava has partially resolved these issues via smart-contract-based accounts. In particular:      Deploy a Multi-Signature wallet in BSC mainnet at the address:   0xdF73aC573Dfd430f4C5558B8CbeD86e86145501B      Set up the owner of the contracts and governance to the multi-signature wallet.  Although these issues are major, our approach can avoid the potential risks of centralization. Moreover, in our roadmap, we will enable DAO Functionalities in Q2–2022. The introduction of the DAO module will completely resolve the centralization issues. This approach will make our community control the process and activity of Trava Finance in the near future.', 'Audit completion by Hacken  This thorough security audit checked and ensured the following imperative points as 2 main Categories (1) Code review (2) Functional.  The audit report contains all found security vulnerabilities and other issues in the reviewed code. As a result of the audit, There are no critical issues in our contracts. Besides, Hacken’s security engineers found 4 high, 4 medium, and 3 low severity issues. Overall, after the auditing process, Hacken evaluated Trava’s contracts as Well-Secured (the highest level of security as the assessment). Severity High  There is one issue regarding the implementation function and three issues regarding uninitialized state variables:      Issue 1 (unimplemented function): The logic of function finalizeTranfer has commented-out unimplemented logic. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.      Issues 2, 3, 4 (uninitialized state variables): Some state variables are not initialized for the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager but they are being called.          Trava’s Response: We consider the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager as a Logic Contract where we execute our code by using delegate call from LendingPool Contract. That explains why we don’t initialize the state for that variable.          Following the verification, Hacken determined that these are not issues.  Severity Medium  There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused imports, Not checked contract address, and No event on lendingPoolConfigurator change. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.  There is one Issue concerning Possible FlashLoan attack in the LendingPool contract. Despite the fact that we do not believe this attack could happen in real life, we took great care in resolving the problem.  Description: IF both of TToken and its underlyingAsset are traded on multiple DEXes and have different rates there could be a FlashLoan attack. Attackers could FlashLoan a TToken, and process withdraw, which will give then the exact same amount of the underlyingAsset, and then calling deposit, they will receive the same amount of TToken.  Having the 1-to-1 “exchange” on the LendingPool and different rates on DEXes, attackers could “play” with the market many times in one transaction until they receive enough rewards. The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.  The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.  Hacken’s Recommendation: Consider some restrictions like minting/returning assets in the next block only.  Trava’s solution: Token transfer restrictions for transferring in the same block where minting occurred.  After the verification, Hacken concluded that the issue had been resolved completely. Severity Low  There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to Unused state variable, public/external function, Unused function argument. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.']","['TRAVA.FINANCE: Connect with TRAVA.FINANCE: Trava Finance is a cross-chain lending marketplace which offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.

Explain EXP and how can I use it for Farming,0.9992,True,"['At the moment, EXP (Experience Point) is the point that shows how long an Armoury NFT is staked in our vaults. EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault.  Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault  We’ve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items).  You can see your EXP  either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace.  Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs. However, when you withdraw your Knight NFT, disassemble and reassemble with different items to get another Knight NFT, your Armoury NFTs will have different EXPs.  For example: You open 4 chests and get: Helmet, Shield, Armour and Weapon. You assemble them into a Knight NFT and farm in our vault. After 24h, the EXPs for Armoury NFTs are as follow:      Weapon EXP: 86400      Shield EXP: 86400      Armor EXP: 86400      Helmet EXP: 86400  So EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400 (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400  After 24h, you withdraw your Knight NFT to reassemble with Armoury NFTs you buy on Trava NFT Marketplace. Suppose, those Armoury NFTs you bought have been already farmed in vault before and have the EXPs as follow:      Weapon EXP: 86400      Shield EXP: 100000      Armor EXP: 320000      Helmet EXP: 210000  Thus, the EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100 (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100  There will be a lot of benefits for NFT owners to have high EXPs. The more EXP you have, the more value the NFT will be. This can help you to distinguish NFT value from other NFTs of the same type and rarity. Moreover, the EXP will be applied in our Trade-up Mechanism which will be launched soon. In the future, EXP will be used with Credit Score and applied to NFT-collateralization. It can be said that EXP is an important factor in Trava Knight NFT to reach our goal of collateralization.', 'Heuristic Farming (Farming based on EXP)  When the new Farming mechanism commences, our 5 current Farming vaults will stop distributing TRAVA as reward, which means our 5 existing vaults will only give back EXP (one EXP for each second in 5 current farming vaults).

Idea At the bear market, Trava Team focuses on building more features and products to expand the Trava Ecosystem. For example, to better manage Trava Lending Pool, Trava Finance has launched Governance. However, we\'d also love to hear more from Trava Knights, and see the different perspectives on the flow of ideas. So with the ultimate goal of building a robust and diverse Lending protocol, we decided to start this Idea Contest. 2. Discussion Raise your idea for developing products in Trava Finance\'s ecosystem: * Trava Lending Pool * Trava Capital * Trava Knight NFT Remember that Trava is Decentralized, so your ideas do not have to be limited to the above, or any technology, community or country. We\'ll listen to everyone\'s opinions, sifting through ideas from varying degrees of plausibility. Ultimately, the development of these services/products is entirely decided by Trava Knights, through a process of discussion and voting. With each idea, the Trava Team will be in charge of evaluation and debate to build the best finalists. The contributions from the Trava community will be a huge strength for the Trava Finance ecosystem. 3. Execution All you have to do is create a Topic with IdeaContest in the title, state your idea and submit it to Trava Forum in any categories of the three: Trava Lending Pool, Knight NFT and Trava Capital. We will be accepting your ideas until 10 A.M. UTC on May 5, 2023. After that, a voting snapshot will be opened, then the best ideas selected for implementation will be rewarded with 500,000 TRAVA. Raise your idea now to build up our ecosystem together! Trava Administration 26 Apr 2023, 10:05 * Welcome to Trava’s forum! posted in For Beginners Welcome to Trava Knights Forum!

There are those who gave not only one but dozens of different opinions, on many aspects and products of Trava Finance. From there, we have selected 10 ideas to proceed further: 1. Open a contest for community members to create their own knights. 2. Restructure the main page of Trava, removing the mountains with links to make it seem more user-friendly and easier to understand Trava\'s focus. 3. Expand to other chains and add new ones, since BNB is in a potentially risky position. 4. Add more DeFi protocols to BRicher, regularly updating good protocols and removing unsafe ones. 5. Simplify the parameters in Lending Pools and add more tokens. Add a type of notification so people would know when liquidations are close. 6. Increase the utility of TRAVA tokens by adding continuous token burn feature, periodically burning minted TRAVA. Allow them to be exchanged on all chains in Trava Lending. 7. Reopen BNB/Trava safety passbook. 8. Launch Knights leasing feature. 9. Do Idea Contest more periodically. 10. Start marketing on Crew3. Motivation: Each of the ideas has been thoroughly researched by us, evaluated for their potential and feasibility. Don\'t be sad if your ideas are not here, they might just be slightly deviating from Trava Finance\'s development orientation, or not yet capable of being put into practice. This discussion is open in order to be able to involve the whole community in contributing to the development of Trava Finance. It’s expected to be a stepping stone before starting the voting snapshot, for everyone to dive deeper into these ideas and voice their own comments. From there, it is also possible for you to pick the best choices for the development of Trava, choosing a worthy winner (or winners). The founders and POs of Trava Finance will also check out this discussion, so don\'t be afraid to dig into each issue and ask the hard questions.

Therefore, we’d like to raise opinions from you guys on: Should TravaGPT support the Polish language? What do you think about this idea? Let’s cast your vote & share your thoughts now! Trava Administration 3 Jul 2024, 21:00 * Call for suggestions to improve Trava Station to best suits your demands. posted in Lending 1. Idea As announced recently, we are preparing to launch the Trava Station. Overall, it is a product expected to help users in our ecosystem have a more comfortable experience, saving time and money. Besides the details that our team is developing, we also want to hear from the community to create a Trava Station truly for you. 2. Information Simply put, this is a platform where you can combine your actions in the Trava ecosystem into a single transaction. The user experience will be increased as you can reduce interaction time with different channels and the gas costs when performing multiple actions. Currently, Trava Station is designed with 4 main features, including Portfolio, Tramlines, Freight, and Junction. In which, Freight is considered the core of this platform, where you can select the needed information and parameters, drag and drop actions to execute in the order you want. To do this, Trava utilizes Smart Wallet , which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create one, which will hold your assets during the Freight operation. After it is finished, the assets in Smart Wallet will return to your Main Wallet (like Metamask, Wallet Connect, etc.). As you can see, the below is the main interface of Freight as of now (we can modify it to be more user-friendly if you have suggestions for product development). In this case for example, you want to buy NFT on the marketplace but don’t have TRAVA, so you decide to supply USDT to borrow TRAVA. With Trava Freight, all those laborious, time-consuming and costly steps can be combined into a single transaction. In the current version, the scope of implementation with Freight in particular and Trava Station in general is still quite limited, mainly focusing on Lending Pool, Marketplaces, users\' wallets… The actions include borrowing, returning assets, adding liquidity or withdrawing, executing conversion orders, buying or selling NFTs, tokens or other digital assets. Of course, we will develop the platform further, add more activities and features in the future, so that everyone has a truly seamless experience in the Trava ecosystem. Portfolio is where you can keep track of your position and all your assets in Smart Wallet in Trava Station. Tramlines and Junction are complementary features to Freight, in which Tramlines provide a list of pre-made sequences with arranged actions for you to import. Meanwhile, Junction consists of sequences that are not executed when you create, but are made active by a system bot only when a condition is reached. * For example, you can create a set of actions to sell TRAVA when the ETH price reaches $1000 — so when this threshold appears, our system bot will execute the pre-arranged actions. 3. Ask After reading the above information, you may have understood a little more about Trava Station and our vision, right? We treasure all your opinions, because you are who Trava Station was built to serve. So let us know what you think about this upcoming product, suggesting for further development!!

B: Backing per TOD Every TOD in circulation is backed by the TraDAO treasury, composed of stablecoins, TOD-stablecoin LP tokens, and other assets. Backing per TOD is the dollar value of each TOD token based on the backing reserve. Backing Reserves Backing Reserves is the sum of all reserve assets' RFV value from the treasury. Bond Installment Installment bonding is one of the regulations of TraDAO, which allow users to pay partly in a certain time when buying bonds; they don’t have to pay all in one go.

Current Index When users stake TOD, they will receive xTOD tokens. The index value represents the conversion ratio between TOD and xTOD. At the initial state of the protocol, the index is 1.0, which means the conversion is 1:1. The index will increase through the rebase process to track how much users’ TOD balance has increased from auto-compounding reward. Index will never decrease, only increase. D: DAO Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a governance mechanism for making decisions in a more trustless and collaborative way. Voting rights are often bound to a governance token. Discount Users have a chance to buy TOD with a discount by purchasing Bonds.

Total Supply TOD is an uncapped token with a dynamic supply depending on market supply-demand. TOD supply increases when minted by Treasury only: 1. TOD is minted and distributed as stakers’ rewards. 2. TOD is minted from bond revenues whenever someone purchases a bond: - TOD is minted for bonders when they redeem after the vesting period and unstake. - TOD is minted for DAO, determined by a rate set by the policy team. Total Value Staked The total value staked is the number of TOD tokens users staked in the staking contract, multiplied by TOD’s price on the market. Treasury The treasury is a basket of assets (e.g., BUSD, DAI, TOD-BUSD LP…) to back the value of TOD. Treasury Balance Complete name is the market value of treasury assets.

What is Token Health and how can it measure a crypto risk?,0.819,False,"['What is Token Health?  Token Health is an index to evaluate the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava is the world-first lending platform that provides this index by collecting and aggregating various types of data from blockchain networks. The health of each token is evaluated as a specific value in the range of [0; 1000]. This health index gives the users a comprehensive overview of tokens in the cryptocurrency world and thus facilitates TRAVA lending and other DEFI businesses. Original features in Trava Token Health  Standardizing value for each indicator: There have been a few projects providing information on tokens such as Coingecko, CoinMarketCap, LunarCrush, CREAM Finance, DMM Exchange, etc. They typically present multiple types of on-chain data represented by raw numbers only. For example, they show the market capitalization of tokens but do not standardize those values, which makes it harder for users to understand the meaning of the values or make a comparison among different tokens. Performing standardization for the numeric indicators, Trava allows users to quickly assess different tokens in terms of MarketCap, Trading Volume, Token Price, etc.  Aggregate all indicators into a single index: Similar projects simply present multiple token indicators to users without combining them into a single index to make a comprehensive assessment of tokens. Trava Token Health Model, which is a user-oriented model, has been built to address this inconvenience by computing those separate indicators and combining all of them into an insightful index, i.e., Token Health. Users can use this single value to evaluate the health of a token and can quickly decide to invest in the token or not.  Utilizing both absolute and relative indicators: The absolute indicators are commonly used in many token-analyzing projects, while relative values are typically being overlooked. The absolute and separated values do not provide many complete insights, as those values \u200b\u200bare not correlated with each other. Different from other projects, Trava makes use of both absolute and relative indicators to evaluate the Token Health in the most precise and overall manner. Let us take an example with tokens A and B. The trading volume of token A is $100M, while that of token B is $10M. People tend to quickly jump to the conclusion that token A outweighs token B with regards to the trading volume. However, when considering the market cap of the two tokens, it shows that the MarketCap of token A is 1000 times greater than that of token A. Thus, in the correlation with the MarketCap, the trading volume of token B is in fact much more impressive than that of token A. The example shows that, by combining absolute and relative indicators, Trava Model provides more comprehensive insights compared with related projects.  Customized UI for each user: The UI for Trava Token Heath can be customized for individual preference. Trava provides users with the leaderboard of all tokens, ranked by the total score (i.e., Token Health) or other single indicators such as market cap, token price, and trading volume. Users can access the historical charts of each indicator to get more insights. Moreover, what makes Trava Token Health special compared to the related projects is that Trava enables users to customize the charts based on their preferences. For example, they can add their favorite tokens with their preferable indicators in a single chart to compare and evaluate multiple tokens in an easy, time-saving, and elegant manner.  Various types of indicators: The Trava Token Health model is constructed based on various parameters in different aspects of DeFi. There are seven main parameters; all are selected and analyzed under a strict process before being deployed to ensure the most reliability and creditworthiness. In addition to the absolute values, we also calculate and analyze the relative values such as: the price over the highest score or the trading volume over the MarketCap. We also consider the fluctuation of the values over time. The detailed model will be presented in the next section Trava Token Health model  Trava has studied and developed an exclusive token rating model. The model takes into account various types of data. At present, the data is grouped into seven main indicators including (1) Market cap, (2) Number of transactions, (3) Volume of transactions, (4) Number of holders, (5) Distribution of tokens to holders, (6) Price, and (7) Price stability. Each indicator in turn is evaluated based on several sub-parameters. The use of Trava Token Health  One of the significant benefits of Token Health is to reduce risks. When participating in the crypto world, users have to face many types of risks such as token price crashes or collateral liquidation when borrowing. Token Health will be a useful tool for users to minimize these risks. They can determine which tokens should not be invested at certain times to avoid risks. Let us take an example of how two major risks can be addressed by Trava Token Health:      Risk of token liquidity. In the DeFi field, price fluctuations can result in risks of loan liquidation for both the pool owners and liquidity providers. With Trava Token Health, the pool owner can choose stable price tokens to allow performing actions in the pool to avoid this risk.     Risk of token inflation. Tokens with high inflation are more likely to have a price crash. Users in DeFi can suffer significant losses due to such crashes. With Trava Token Health, users have a full overview of token price, using our price stability indicator, the price over the highest score, or the Token Health index. This information is an effective tool for users to avoid the risk of tokens’ price crashes.  Moreover, Trava Token Health assists users to make optimal decisions on token investing. In the past, choosing which tokens to invest, lend or borrow, was a major problem for users in the crypto world because there was no credible basis for them to assess the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava Token Health allows users to observe the history of multiple token indicators and the overall Token Health index to be more confident when making their investment decisions.']","['P: Price score in tokens health analytics The quotient of the current token price and the highest token price in the last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 100 days, and all-time.

R: Reputation Rank History A record of the reputation rank in the past.', 'What is Health factor?: Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation?: The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals.', 'H: Holders distribution score The standardized value that evaluates the equal distribution of the token among holders.

Number of transaction scores in token health analytics The standardized value of the total number of transactions related to the token in the last 24 hours, 7 days, and 100 days.', ""Introduction: In borrowing, when a borrowers’ health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value, a liquidation process might happen. In other words, borrowers’ collateral value decreases or borrowed value increases against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation that amount liquidated from your debt is repaid. How much is the liquidation penalty?: The liquidation penalty (or bonus for liquidators) depends on the asset used as collateral. How to avoid being liquidated?: In order to avoid collateral liquidation, you need to maintain your health factor at a safe level. To increase health factor, you can pay back a part of your loans or deposit more assets for your borrowing amount. Among two available options, repaying the loan would increase your health factor more. We mention you should keep your health factor over 2.

The knowledge graph data validators stake by TRAVA. * Staking to participate in the governance process: TRAVA.FINANCE will become a community solution, thus the TRAVA.FINANCE’s rules are elected by participants, who hold TRAVA’s token.""]","['https://gov.trava.finance/about', 'https://docs.trava.finance/user-guide/trava-pool-creation-user-guide', 'https://gov.trava.finance/user/administration', 'https://docs.trava.finance/glossary/trava-governance-glossary', 'https://docs.trava.finance/faq']","['https://docs.trava.finance/governance', 'https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-the-security-advisory-board-for-the-trava-governance-8bcf6799e90f']"
Explain TRADAO and its public offering.,0.8738,True,"['What is TRADAO?  TRADAO is the world’s first protocol supporting multi-chain deployment in DeFi 2.0, and also Web 3.0 compatible. TraDAO is protocol owned liquidity (POL), accumulating value through such activities of bonding and auto-compound staking which are regulated by Trava Treasury. As a product in Trava ecosystem, the liquidity owned by TRADAO protocol could be deposited in Trava Lending Pool to generate more profit and this profit will be shared among users in the entire Trava ecosystem.  TRADAO Protocol will issue a decentralized reserve currency — called TOD. The concept behind TOD token is that it is backed by a basket of assets in Trava Treasury that ensures it does not fall below its base value of $1. The TOD token will be released based on the “Mint & Burn” mechanism, managed by no one other than TRADAO protocol. Why is TRADAO different compared to other OHM forks?  In comparison to other initiatives in the DeFi 2.0 space, TRADAO Protocol offers a number of unique advantages to users. How does it work?  Our Bonding allows users to buy TOD at a discounted price compared with exchanges in other assets such as stablecoins, LP tokens, and so on. The number of TOD tokens that the bonder is entitled to will be vested in a certain term.  Bond Installment is a one-of-a-kind feature that allows users to buy more TOD with a little initial amount of assets, then leverage benefits in Staking Strategy, and pay off the debt. Your bond shall be automatically staked after you use Bond Installment.  Wallet Reputation will be integrated with this product in the form of a reference to decide which user will have more benefits (i.e, lower prepaid rate, lower interest fee rate, higher liquidation discount rate,…). For example, holding assets in the Trava Ecosystem can be considered as a condition to gain a high wallet reputation.  Our Staking allows bonders to stake their TOD token in our auto-compounding vault and earn rebase rewards, after receiving TOD tokens from bond sales. The rebase rewards are also from bond sales held in Trava treasury, or profit of the protocol.', 'We are opening two public offering rounds to give our loyal users as well as our new investors more opportunities to take part in the TraDAO Protocol at the very first stage. In both rounds, participants will buy $TOD tokens in BUSD. The details of two rounds are as the table below:  To get off to a good start, Trava will contribute to TraDAO Protocol with $50,000 worth of 20,000 $TOD tokens. This support is to ensure initial liquidity of $TOD and show the commitment of Trava team in developing TraDAO protocol, thus bringing trust to our community and staying the true ideology of Trava since the beginning, that is a fair launch project and independent of any whale or VCs. The funds from sale will be used to back the $TOD sold and provide initial liquidity after listing.  If we are 100% subscribed, the sale will bring in $345,000. $105,000 will be deposited to the treasury to back initial supply. The remaining $240,000 will be added as liquidity. The LP will open on PancakeSwap with 240,000 BUSD and 20,000 $TOD, in addition to 85,000 $TOD from Public Offering and contribution of Trava Team. This means the starting price of $TOD is $12, and total initial liquidity on Pancakeswap is $480,000 of both tokens. Thus, the total Initial Supply of $TOD will be 105,000 $TOD. How can I join Public Offering?  We will also open two (02) Rounds of Whitelist, which will then be merged to one Final Whitelist at the end. The two rounds open to welcome new Knights and incentives for Loyal Knights in the TRAVA ecosystem as follows:      Whitelist Round 1 (will be live on Jan 21st) — Power up TRADAO — To welcome new members into TRAVA Ecosystem     Whitelist Round 2 (will be live on Jan 28th) — Cheer up Trava Knights — To honor TRAVA loyal users  Participants in the Final Whitelist will have a lucky ticket in buying $TOD Token at the cheapest price before it hits the official launch on PancakeSwap. When you buy, you are removed from the whitelist; if some people buy less than their share, everyone who has not yet bought will get a higher allocation. The details of each Round will be released in our next announcements.  After the public offering rounds, we plan to open two strategies of Bonding and Staking for users to leverage their rewards and earn profit from them. We also have a plan to allow Bond Installment and Wallet Reputation for Bond purchases, which creates a perfect gateway for users with small funds to invest and profit from the protocol.']","['1. Idea: Starting from TraDAO and turning into Trava Capital, its growth is closely connected to our community. Correspondingly, when technology reaches another high and the market is in a bullish phase with many opportunities awaiting, it’s time for renovation and innovation. Therefore, our team has discussed carefully and had the first thoughts about the updates we can make with Trava Capital. We intend to separate it from Trava Finance into its own being — an AI platform that enables running liquidity provision strategies on blockchains. But no matter which direction we go, our ultimate goal is still to benefit users and the entire Trava ecosystem. Our community is always the center.', 'Trava Capital — The Investing Model: We are now at the very first steps of rebranding TraDAO to Trava Capital, which is expected to bring users profits from various…: Oct 25, 2022 Oct 25, 2022 TRAVA CAPITAL — TREASURY INVESTING MODEL: Given the community’s decision through the snapshot on September 30, 2022, we have rebranded TraDAO to Trava Capital.

Connect with TRAVA.FINANCE', 'M: Market Cap The market cap (or market capitalization) is the total dollar value of TOD tokens in circulation. Market Value of Treasury Assets Market Value of Treasury Assets is the sum of the value (in dollars) of all assets held by the treasury Multi-chain Deployment TraDAO will be deployed on multiple chains in the future, which opens more opportunities for new investors to get more rewards while bonding and staking in our TraDAO system. N: Next Reward Amount The next reward amount is the increasing number of a user’s TOD balance in the next rebase. Next Reward Yield Reward yield is the interest rate for compounding staking. This reward yield depends on the total value staked and the treasury’s balance. It may change each epoch to achieve sustainable reward emission. P: Protocol Owned Liquidity Protocol Owned Liquidity is the amount of LP the treasury owns and controls Purchased Every bond program has a capacity, set at the opening time and can not be changed. Purchased parameter is the percentage of bond sold over its capacity.', 'Trava Capital: Besides Trava Knight NFT, Trava Lending, Ticket also has its own role in TraDAO as a supportive asset. As a result, investors of TraDAO will enjoy the APR increase while owning a Ticket. Play-to-earn in MiniGame Series: Tickets will act like rewards and entrances for Fortune Mining. The detailed mechanism will be released soon. Moreover, users can earn more Tickets (besides the winning bet) by joining the Battle Hand MiniGame. In the near future, more MiniGames will be launched with the integration of Ticket. Trade-to-earn: Besides the above, users can also sell Counter Tickets at Trava Counter at 80% of the current Counter price. Moreover, all Ticket types, including Counter Tickets, Presale Tickets, and Incentive Tickets, can be sold in the Ticket Marketplace at a price determined by sellers (peer-to-peer). With the potential ability of Ticket, right after release, the Ticket utilities will be implemented throughout the Trava ecosystem. In the long term, more and more Ticket features will be released to meet the demand of Trava users constantly. : Business Model', 'Register: Step 1: * Go to: https://gov.trava.finance/ * Click “Register” Step 2: * Enter “Username” * Enter “Password” * Confirm ""Password"" * Click “Register Now” Step 3: * Fill in your email address * Click “Submit” Step 4: Confirm your registration in the mail box Log in: Step 1: * Go to: https://gov.trava.finance/ * Click “Login” Step 2: * Put in email address * Enter password * Click “Login” Open topic: Step 1: * Choose the category you would like to discuss Step 2: Create your discussion Step 3: See your topic posted on the Forum Step 4: Tracking your discussions * Click the bell button * Switch to “Watching” to receive all the related notifications.
