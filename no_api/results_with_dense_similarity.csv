,What is Trava Finance?,"Trava Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform focused on building a credit-based ecosystem on blockchain. It provides a decentralized lending marketplace, allowing users to:
	•	Create and manage their own lending pools with customizable parameters (like interest rates, collateral requirements, etc.)
	•	Borrow and lend crypto assets using a wide range of collateral types.
	•	Use credit scoring mechanisms to evaluate borrower reliability, offering more flexible and potentially undercollateralized loans.

Key Features of Trava Finance:
	1.	Decentralized Lending Pools
Unlike traditional DeFi platforms with centralized pool control, Trava lets users create their own pools and set policies that match their risk appetite.
	2.	Credit Risk Assessment
Trava uses credit scoring models, including on-chain data and AI analysis, to assess users’ creditworthiness — a relatively novel approach in DeFi.
	3.	Multi-chain Support
Originally launched on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Trava also expands to other chains to support interoperability.
	4.	Trava Token (TRAVA)
The platform’s native token is used for:
	•	Governance (voting on proposals)
	•	Incentives (rewards, staking)
	•	Paying for services within the Trava ecosystem.
	5.	Marketplace Flexibility
Lenders can choose which pools to join and tailor risk/return preferences, while borrowers get more customized loan options.
	6.	Security & DAO Governance
Trava emphasizes decentralized governance, allowing token holders to vote on important protocol decisions.

Use Cases:
	•	Creating lending pools for specific communities or purposes.
	•	Accessing capital without centralized intermediaries.
	•	Leveraging a unique DeFi credit score to secure better borrowing conditions.

,Do I need to pay fees to interconnect with Trava protocol?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, you do not need to pay any fees to integrate or interconnect with the Trava protocol itself — it’s a permissionless, open DeFi platform built on blockchain. However, there are a few types of costs or fees you should be aware of depending on how you’re interacting:

⸻

✅ No Fees for Integration
	•	Developers and dApps can freely interact with Trava smart contracts.
	•	No licensing, subscription, or API usage fees.
	•	You can use Web3 libraries (e.g., ethers.js) or Subgraph without paying Trava directly.

⸻

⚠️ You Will Pay Blockchain Gas Fees
	•	Since Trava is deployed on BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain), every transaction (e.g., lending, borrowing, pool creation) requires a gas fee paid in BNB.
	•	Typical actions that cost gas:
	•	Supplying assets
	•	Borrowing
	•	Repaying loans
	•	Creating a new lending pool
	•	Voting in governance

⸻

💸 Protocol-Level Fees (for users, not developers)

Some actions on Trava may include protocol-defined fees, which go to the protocol treasury or pool owners:
	•	Borrowing interest (paid to lenders)
	•	Liquidation incentives (paid to liquidators)
	•	Pool creation fee (might be required when launching your own pool)
	•	Withdrawal fees (if defined by the pool manager)

These are not integration fees, but rather economic mechanisms of the protocol.

⸻

🔐 Example: Costs to Create a Custom Lending Pool
	•	Gas fee to deploy the pool
	•	Possible protocol fee or deposit required depending on Trava’s governance settings

⸻

Summary

Action	Fee Required?	Notes
Reading data (via Subgraph/API)	❌	Free
Writing to contracts (supply, borrow)	✅	Requires gas (BNB)
Creating a lending pool	✅	Gas + possible Trava fee
Using SDK or Web3 calls	❌	Free to use
Governance voting	✅	Gas only


⸻

Let me know if you want a breakdown of fees for a specific interaction, such as borrowing or creating a pool.","Yes, you may need to pay certain fees when interacting with the Trava Finance protocol, but it depends on the type of interaction. Here’s a breakdown of what you might pay for:

⸻

💸 1. Blockchain Gas Fees
	•	Yes, you must pay gas fees for all on-chain transactions.
	•	These are network fees, not fees taken by Trava.
	•	Since Trava mainly runs on BNB Chain (BSC), gas fees are relatively low (usually <$0.10 USD per transaction).

Examples:

Action	Gas Fee Required?
Lending/supplying tokens	✅ Yes
Borrowing or repaying loans	✅ Yes
Staking or withdrawing TRAVA tokens	✅ Yes
Creating a custom lending pool	✅ Yes
Voting in governance	✅ Yes


⸻

💰 2. Protocol Fees

Trava may charge protocol-level fees on certain actions. These are built into the smart contracts.

Common Protocol Fees:
	•	Interest Spread: When borrowing, a portion of the interest goes to lenders, and part may be kept by the protocol or pool creator.
	•	Liquidation Fee: If a borrower’s position is liquidated, a fee may be taken from the collateral.
	•	Pool Management Fees (for custom pools): Creators may set their own fee structure for using their pool.

⸻

🧾 3. No Subscription or External Fee
	•	No need to pay to access the protocol or API.
	•	No subscription or monthly fee to use Trava.
	•	Everything is open and on-chain — you pay only for what you use.

⸻

✅ Summary: What You Pay

Fee Type	Mandatory?	Who Gets It?
Gas Fees	✅ Yes	Blockchain validators
Interest/Lending Fees	✅ Yes	Lenders & Trava protocol
NFT Appraisal (if any)	❌ Possibly	Trava or 3rd-party tools
Governance Voting	✅ Yes	Gas fee only

Trava token is issued based on Binance Smart Chain’s BEP20 standard.\nTrava token is a functional utility token which will be used as the medium of exchange between participants on TRAVA.FINANCE in a decentralised manner. The goal of introducing Trava token is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on TRAVA.FINANCE, and it is not, and not intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public (or a section of the public) as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt; nor is it designed or intended to be used by any person as payment for any goods or services whatsoever that are not exclusively provided by the issuer. Trava token does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will Trava token entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. Trava token may only be utilised on TRAVA.FINANCE, and ownership of Trava token carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use Trava token as a means to enable usage of and interaction within TRAVA.FINANCE.\nTrava also provides the economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to contribute to and participate in the ecosystem on TRAVA.FINANCE, thereby creating a mutually beneficial system where every participant is fairly compensated for its efforts. Trava token is an integral and indispensable part of TRAVA.FINANCE, because without Trava token, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on TRAVA.FINANCE. Given that additional Trava token will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage, activity and contribution on TRAVA.FINANCE and/or proportionate to the frequency and volume of transactions, users of TRAVA.FINANCE and/or holders of Trava token which did not actively participate will not receive any Trava token incentives.\nTrava token is used in 4 main areas: (1) Reward (2) Collateral & Lending (3) Payment (4) Staking:\n 1. **Reward:** To incentivise users to provide liquidity to pools, pool owners can set up rewards paid in TRAVA token.\n 2. **Collateral and lending:** TRAVA tokens may be used as the basic collateral for loans and mortgages.\n 3. **Payment for lending fees:** As the native platform currency, TRAVA tokens may be used to pay for lending fees in TRAVA.FINANCE pools.\n 4. **Payment for pool management:** As the native platform currency, TRAVA tokens may be used by pool owners to pay for pool management by TRAVA.FINANCE.\n 5. **Payment for auction deposits:** In the NFT auction process, TRAVA tokens can be used as the deposit for purchase transactions.\n 6. **Payment for auction organization:** The NFT’s owners (auction organizers) may pay for auction fees with TRAVA tokens.\n 7. **Staking for a validator:** The data stored on the knowledge graph chain must be verified by validators. As an indication of commitment and service standard assurance, validators would be required to put up an amount of Trava token as a security deposit (i.e. a \""stake\"") before being entitled to participate in the ecosystem. Where validators commit offences (e.g. incorrect information, unacceptable down-time, or other malicious acts), this stake may be slashed.\n 8. **Staking to participate in the governance process:** The Trava token would allow holders to create and vote on on-chain governance proposals to determine future features of TRAVA.FINANCE, with voting weight calculated in proportion to the tokens staked (the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of TRAVA.FINANCE; it does not entitle Trava token holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such assets to token holders, or select the board of directors of these entities, or determine the development direction of these entities, does not constitute any equity interest in any of these entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint venture or partnership). ####\nToken Allocation\nTotal Supply — Capped at **5,000,000,000 TRAVA**\nWe distribute tokenomics with a long-term vision and sustainability for the project.

,Is there a limited amount to deposit/stake?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, there is no fixed global limit on how much you can deposit or stake, but limits may apply depending on:

⸻

🔒 1. Lending Pools – Deposit Limits
	•	Custom Pools: Trava allows users to create their own lending pools. Each pool can define:
	•	Deposit limits per asset
	•	Total pool cap
	•	Collateral usage limits

✅ Default pools often do not impose a strict deposit limit, but:

Always review the parameters of the specific pool before depositing.

⸻

🪙 2. Staking TRAVA Tokens
	•	Trava offers staking for TRAVA tokens (e.g., for governance or rewards).
	•	Staking contracts usually don’t have a hard cap unless specified.
	•	Some pools may feature individual caps per wallet (e.g., for fair distribution during early campaigns or airdrops).

⸻

⚠️ Possible Restrictions or Limits

Scenario	Limit Type	Notes
Lending Pool	Custom limits	Set by pool creators
TRAVA Staking	Sometimes capped	For promotional reasons
Farming / Liquidity Mining	May have phase-based caps	To control reward dilution
Collateral Usage	LTV limits apply	Limits how much you can borrow


⸻

📌 Summary

Action	Global Limit?	Custom Limit?
Deposit in Pools	❌	✅ (per pool)
Stake TRAVA	❌	✅ (per program)
Borrow	✅ (based on LTV)	✅ (by pool)


⸻

If you have a specific action or pool in mind (e.g., staking TRAVA in Vault A or depositing BUSD in Pool X), I can help check the limits for that exact case.","Trava Finance does not impose strict limits on how much you can deposit or stake, but there are some practical and protocol-level considerations you should be aware of:

⸻

✅ 1. No Fixed Deposit or Stake Limit
	•	There is no minimum or maximum deposit amount enforced by the Trava protocol itself.
	•	You can deposit or stake any amount of supported tokens — even small amounts (e.g., $1) — as long as you have enough to cover gas fees.

⸻

⚠️ 2. Gas Fees and Token Approvals
	•	On BNB Chain, gas fees are low (typically <$0.10), but:
	•	If your deposit is too small, the gas cost may outweigh the benefits.
	•	You may need to approve tokens before depositing/staking — this step also costs gas.

⸻

📉 3. Pool Capacity and Utilization
	•	Lending pools may have utilization caps:
	•	If a pool is fully utilized (almost all funds borrowed), you may not be able to withdraw your deposit until more liquidity returns.
	•	Some custom pools could impose caps per user or per asset, depending on the creator’s settings.

⸻

🧊 4. Staking Programs May Have Custom Rules
	•	Specific staking campaigns (e.g., TRAVA token staking or liquidity farming) may include:
	•	Minimum staking threshold (e.g., 1000 TRAVA)
	•	Reward tiers or multipliers
	•	Lock-up periods (some pools may be time-locked)

Always check the specific pool or campaign details on Trava’s staking dashboard.

⸻

✅ Summary

Factor	Limitation?	Notes
Minimum deposit	❌ No	But gas cost makes small deposits inefficient
Maximum deposit	❌ No	Protocol doesn’t limit deposit size
Staking minimum	⚠️ Possibly	Depends on specific staking program
Withdrawal limitation	⚠️ Yes (if pool is fully borrowed)	Applies only in some lending scenarios

,What is the maximum amount can I borrow?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, the maximum amount you can borrow depends on several key factors — there is no fixed global limit, but borrowing power is determined dynamically based on collateral value, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and pool configurations.

⸻

🔢 Factors That Determine Borrowing Limits

✅ 1. Your Supplied Collateral
	•	The more collateral you supply, the more you can borrow.
	•	The value of your collateral is determined by market prices of the assets you deposit.

✅ 2. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio
	•	Each collateral asset has a maximum LTV (e.g., 60%).
	•	This means you can borrow up to 60% of the value of your collateral.
Example:
If you supply $1,000 worth of BUSD, and BUSD’s LTV is 60%,
→ You can borrow up to $600 in other supported assets.

✅ 3. Pool Parameters
	•	Each lending pool (especially custom pools) may set:
	•	Maximum borrow per asset
	•	Borrowing caps
	•	Minimum collateral requirements
	•	Supported asset pairs

✅ 4. Health Factor
	•	Borrowing is limited to ensure your health factor stays above a critical threshold (usually > 1.0).
	•	If your health factor drops too low due to price volatility, you risk liquidation.

✅ 5. Your Credit Score (Future Feature)
	•	Trava plans to enable credit-based borrowing using on-chain credit scores.
	•	This could allow under-collateralized borrowing for users with strong credit.

⸻

⚠️ Practical Borrow Limit Formula

Maximum Borrow = Collateral Supplied × LTV × Health Margin

Example:
	•	Supplied 1,000 USDT
	•	LTV = 65%
	•	Safety margin = 95% (to avoid liquidation)
→ Max Safe Borrow = 1,000 × 0.65 × 0.95 = $617.5

⸻

Would you like help calculating your exact borrowing power based on a specific token or pool?","The maximum amount you can borrow on Trava Finance depends on several dynamic factors — it’s not a fixed number. Here’s a clear breakdown:

⸻

🔢 1. Based on Collateral Value

You can borrow up to a certain percentage of your collateral’s value, depending on:

➤ Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)
	•	Each token has its own LTV ratio, e.g.:
	•	USDT: 75%
	•	BNB: 70%
	•	BTC: 65%
	•	So if you supply $1,000 of USDT, you could borrow up to $750 worth of assets.

⸻

📉 2. Affected by Risk Parameters

Each lending pool has its own configuration:
	•	Collateral factor: How much value is usable for borrowing
	•	Borrow limit factor: May vary depending on the token’s volatility
	•	Pool-wide limits: Pools can impose maximum total borrowing caps

⸻

🖼️ 3. If Using NFTs as Collateral
	•	Borrowing limits are based on NFT valuation, which is:
	•	Determined by Trava’s NFT valuation engine or market floor price
	•	Subject to risk ratings (some NFTs may have lower LTVs, e.g., 30–50%)

⸻

📊 4. Protocol-Wide vs. Custom Pools
	•	Main Trava Pools (like on BNB Chain): Have relatively high liquidity and relaxed limits.
	•	Custom Pools: Created by users or DAOs can have stricter caps or more conservative LTVs.

⸻

🔐 5. Real-Time Limit Check

When you attempt to borrow via Trava App:
	•	The system calculates your maximum borrowing power in real time.
	•	It shows your safe borrow limit and liquidation threshold.

⸻

✅ Example:

Collateral Token	Value Supplied	LTV	Max Borrow Amount
BUSD	$1,000	75%	$750
BNB	$1,000	70%	$700
NFT (mid-tier)	$1,000	40%	$400


⸻

⚠️ Risk Warning:
	•	If your borrowed amount exceeds the safe threshold (due to price drop), your position may be liquidated.
	•	Always borrow well below the max limit, e.g., 50–60% of borrowing power, for safety.

,How much interest would I pay for my loans?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, the interest you pay on loans depends on several dynamic factors and varies by lending pool and asset. There is no fixed rate — instead, Trava uses a variable interest rate model based on pool utilization.

⸻

💸 How Interest Works on Trava Loans

✅ 1. Interest Is Variable
	•	The borrow interest rate increases as the pool becomes more utilized.
	•	Utilization = the ratio of borrowed funds to total supplied liquidity.
	•	Each pool may use a different interest rate model, especially custom-created ones.

⸻

📈 2. Interest Rate Formula (Simplified)

Trava uses models similar to Aave/Compound:

Borrow Interest Rate = Base Rate + (Utilization Rate × Multiplier)

Some pools may use jump-rate models, where interest increases sharply past a certain utilization threshold.

⸻

🔍 3. Where to View Your Loan Interest

On https://station.trava.finance:
	•	Go to the Borrow section of a pool.
	•	Select the asset — you’ll see:
	•	Current borrow rate (%)
	•	APY estimate
	•	Health factor impact

You can also monitor the accrued interest in “My Borrowings” dashboard.

⸻

📉 4. Interest Accrual
	•	Interest accrues per block and compounds continuously.
	•	You repay the principal + accrued interest when closing your loan.
	•	You can also make partial repayments at any time.

⸻

🧾 Example

Scenario	Value
Borrowed Asset	500 BUSD
Borrow Rate	8% APY
Loan Term (e.g., 1 month)	30 days
Estimated Interest	~$3.29

(500 × 8%) / 12 ≈ 3.33 USD for 30 days)

⸻

📌 Summary

Factor	Impact on Interest
Pool Utilization	Higher → higher rate
Asset Type	Volatile assets often → higher rate
Pool Parameters	Each pool sets its own model
Loan Duration	Longer = more interest accrued
Repayment Frequency	You can repay anytime to stop accrual


⸻

Would you like help estimating your specific interest for a certain amount or asset (e.g., borrow 1000 USDT for 14 days)?","The interest you pay on loans in Trava Finance depends on several dynamic factors. There is no fixed APR — interest rates are variable and determined by the supply and demand within each lending pool.

⸻

🔢 Key Factors That Determine Loan Interest

✅ 1. Borrowed Asset Type
	•	Each token has its own interest rate curve.
	•	Example:
	•	USDT: Might have lower rates due to high liquidity
	•	BNB or volatile tokens: Usually higher interest rates

⸻

✅ 2. Pool Utilization Rate
	•	Higher utilization = higher interest.
	•	Utilization is calculated as:

Utilization Rate = Total Borrowed / Total Supplied


	•	As the pool gets more borrowed, interest rates increase to incentivize more supply.

⸻

✅ 3. Lending Pool Parameters
	•	Trava pools use a variable interest rate model with breakpoints. For example:
	•	0–80% utilization: ~5–15% APR
	•	80–100% utilization: Spikes to 20–40% or higher
	•	Some custom pools may set different curves.

⸻

📈 Example Interest Rate Curve

Utilization Rate	Estimated APR
20%	~5%
50%	~8%
75%	~12%
90%	~20–25%
100%	>40% (if not capped)


⸻

📊 How to Check Your Actual Interest Rate
	1.	Go to https://app.trava.finance
	2.	Connect your wallet
	3.	Click on the token you want to borrow
	4.	Look for:
	•	Current Borrow APR
	•	Real-time utilization
	•	Your estimated interest accrual

⸻

💡 Tips to Lower Your Interest:

Tip	Benefit
✅ Borrow during low utilization	Lower APR
✅ Use stablecoins as collateral	May offer better borrow terms
✅ Choose low-risk tokens	Often have more favorable interest rates
✅ Monitor and repay early	Interest accrues per block, so early repayment saves costs

,How can I withdraw on Trava?,"To withdraw on Trava Finance, you simply remove your supplied (deposited) assets from a lending pool — either partially or fully. This is done through the Trava Station interface and depends on your current borrowings and health factor.

Here’s how to withdraw step by step, based on the official documentation:

⸻

🧾 Step-by-Step: How to Withdraw on Trava

✅ 1. Go to Trava Station
	•	Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect)
	•	Ensure you’re on BNB Chain

⸻

✅ 2. Go to “Your Supply” Section
	•	Click on the Lending Pool you interacted with
	•	Select the asset you previously supplied (e.g., BUSD, USDT)

⸻

Health factor < 1 (too risky)	Withdrawal not allowed until you repay part of your loan or deposit more collateral


⸻

🔐 Example
	•	You supplied 1,000 BUSD
	•	You borrowed 500 USDT
	•	If BUSD’s LTV = 60%, you must maintain at least 833.33 BUSD as collateral to cover your loan
→ You can only withdraw up to 166.67 BUSD

⸻

🛑 Can’t Withdraw? Try This:
	•	Repay part or all of your borrowings

It means you would be no longer entitled to the potential upside value gain. Whereas, by borrowing, you can still obtain these potential earnings (working capital) without losing your asset. You can borrow when unexpected expenses happen and leverage your holding assets for other investment opportunities. ##\n**How to borrow?**\nIn order to borrow, you need to deposit any asset to be used as collateral first (check out the Depositing & Earning FAQ section for more info). After depositing, you simply go to the “Borrow” section and click the “Borrow” button on the asset you want to borrow. Input the amount and approve the transaction. The borrowed amount is based on the available deposits that you used as collateral. ##\n**What is the maximum amount can I borrow?**\nThe maximum amount you can borrow depends on your deposited value and the available liquidity. Please notice the health factor and liquidation threshold indicators to guarantee your collaterals are in the state of safety. Besides, you can not borrow if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor is too low. ##\n**What type of asset do I repay my loans?**\nWhen repaying a loan, the type of asset that you need to repay is in the same asset you borrowed. For example, if you borrow 1 BNB you will pay back 1 BNB plus interest accrued. Another way to pay back the loan is using your collateral. If you want to pay back the loan based on USD price you can borrow any of the available stable coins as USDC, DAI, USDT, etc. ##\n**How much interest would I pay for my loans?**\nWhen borrowing, the interest rate you need to pay depends on the borrowing rate which is determined from the supply and demand ratio of the asset. Moreover, the interest rate is a variable rate so that it changes constantly. The current borrowing rate of your borrowed assets is shown in the Borrowing section of your dashboard, you can check it any time."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/faq/borrowing"", ""rrf_score"": 0.08333333333333333 }, { ""content"": ""##\nBrief description of Trava\nTRAVA is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending.

TRAVA also offers the credit score function based on financial data on-chain analysis as a useful tool that reduces risk and increases profits for all users.\nWe build our solutions on TRAVA.FINANCE whose smart contracts are deployed on BSC network, so the speed of transactions, gas fees, and robustness depend on BSC network. However, in the near future, we will allow cross-chain lending in our platform.\nPlease join the the Trava team and members of the community look forward to helping you understand and use Trava. ##\nWhy should we trust Trava?\nTrava Protocol has been audited and secured internally, by third parties (Hacken, Certik) and even Community Checks.\nCheck https://docs.trava.finance/security/ for more information. ##\n**How to interconnect with Trava protocol**?\nIn order to interconnect with Trava protocol, you need to deposit your asset into lending pools. After depositing, you will earn passive income, this income is based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, you can also borrow by using your deposited assets as collateral. ##\nDo I need to pay fees to interconnect with Trava protocol?\nInteracting with the protocol requires transactions and so transaction fees for BSC Blockchain usage, which depend on the network status and transaction complexity."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/faq"", ""rrf_score"": 0.08333333333333333 }, { ""content"": ""##\n**What is Health factor?**\nHealth factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. ##\n**What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation?**\nThe health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals. ##\n**When do I need to repay the loan?**\nAs long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan. However, the accrued interest of your borrowing will grow day by day, making your health factor decrease. When it reaches the threshold of liquidation, your deposited assets are more likely to fall into liquidation status. ##\n**How to repay the loan?**\nIn order to pay back the loan you go to the Borrowings section of your dashboard and click on the repay button for the asset you borrowed and want to repay.

,How to avoid being liquidated?,"To avoid being liquidated on Trava Finance, you must actively manage your borrowing position to maintain a safe health factor and respond to market changes. Trava follows standard DeFi liquidation mechanisms, where loans are liquidated if the value of your collateral falls too low relative to your debt.

Based on the official documentation, here’s how you can prevent liquidation:

⸻

🚨 What Triggers Liquidation?

You will be liquidated if your Health Factor drops below 1.0.

Health Factor (HF) is calculated as:

HF = (Collateral Value × Liquidation Threshold) / Debt Value


⸻

✅ How to Avoid Being Liquidated

1. 🔒 Maintain a High Health Factor
	•	A Health Factor > 1.5 is considered safe.
	•	If it approaches 1.1 or below, your position is at high risk.

You can check your current health factor in the “My Borrowings” section on Trava Station.

⸻

2. 📈 Monitor Market Conditions
	•	Falling collateral prices can reduce your HF.
	•	Rising interest rates can increase your debt.

Set alerts or regularly monitor crypto market prices and your borrowing status.

⸻

3. 📤 Repay Part of Your Debt
	•	Reduces the total debt, improving your HF.
	•	You can repay partially at any time.

⸻

4. 💰 Supply More Collateral
	•	Increases your total collateral value.
	•	Also improves your borrowing power and health factor.

⸻

5. 🧮 Avoid Over-Borrowing
	•	Don’t max out your borrowing limit.
	•	Stay well below the maximum allowed to buffer against volatility.

⸻

6. 🛠️ Choose Low-Volatility Collateral
	•	Stablecoins (e.g., BUSD, USDT) are less likely to drop in value suddenly.
	•	High-volatility assets like BTC or ETH are riskier if used as collateral.

⸻

7. 📊 Use Pools with Safe Parameters
	•	Some pools have more conservative LTV and liquidation thresholds.
	•	Review pool settings before borrowing.

⸻

🧾 Summary Table

Action	Effect
Maintain HF > 1.5	Safe zone
Repay loan	Reduces debt
Add more collateral	Raises HF
Avoid full borrowing	Buffer against volatility
Watch prices closely	React to market changes
Avoid risky pools	Use pools with safe parameters


⸻

Would you like help calculating your current health factor, or setting up a simulation to test how much price drop would trigger liquidation for your position?","To avoid being liquidated on Trava Finance, you need to actively manage your collateral and loan position to stay above the protocol’s risk thresholds. Here’s a complete guide:

⸻

🛑 What is Liquidation?

Liquidation happens when your borrowed amount plus interest exceeds the maximum allowed borrowing limit, based on the value of your collateral and the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio.

⸻

✅ Top Strategies to Avoid Liquidation

1. 🔒 Maintain a Safe Borrow Limit
	•	Never borrow the maximum allowed amount.
	•	Aim to borrow 50–60% of your borrowing power (not 80–90%).

LTV Allowed	Safe Borrow Target
75%	~50% of collateral value
70%	~45–50%


⸻

2. 📉 Monitor Collateral Value
	•	Your collateral value can drop with market volatility.
	•	Example:
	•	You supplied $1,000 of BNB
	•	BNB drops 30% → Collateral is now $700
	•	You’re suddenly near liquidation if your loan is >$500

✅ Use stablecoins (e.g., USDT, BUSD) as collateral if you want less risk from price drops.

⸻

3. 🔁 Repay Early or Partially
	•	Repaying part of your loan reduces risk.
	•	Interest compounds over time — even small repayments help keep your borrow usage ratio low.

⸻

4. 🔄 Add More Collateral
	•	You can deposit more collateral at any time to improve your collateral ratio.
	•	Especially useful when the market is dipping.

⸻

5. 📊 Track Your Health Factor
	•	Trava shows a “health factor” for your position:
	•	HF > 1.5 → Safe
	•	HF < 1.1 → At risk
	•	HF = 1 → Liquidation imminent

📍 Health Factor Formula:

Health Factor = (Collateral Value × Liquidation Threshold) / Total Borrowed


⸻

6. 🔔 Set Alerts
	•	Use portfolio trackers (like DeBank, Zapper, or Trava’s own dashboard) to set alerts when:
	•	Collateral drops
	•	Borrowed usage increases
	•	Health factor falls near 1.2

⸻

7. ⚠️ Avoid Illiquid or Volatile Tokens as Collateral
	•	Assets with low liquidity or sharp volatility may:
	•	Be harder to liquidate
	•	Be more prone to price crashes
	•	Use blue-chip tokens (BNB, ETH, stablecoins) for safer collateral

⸻

💡 Example

Scenario	Action to Stay Safe
BNB price drops	Add more BNB or repay loan
Borrowing close to max	Repay part of loan or reduce borrow
Interest is accruing fast	Check if you’re over-utilizing your limit


⸻

🧠 Summary: How to Avoid Liquidation

Tip	Effect
✅ Borrow below 60% of limit	Keeps buffer for price drops
✅ Use stablecoins as collateral	Reduces volatility risk
✅ Monitor health factor	Track how close you are to danger
✅ Add collateral or repay	Two key ways to boost safety
✅ Set alerts	React quickly to market changes

By participating in this pool, which now supports above 15 assets, users can now get enormous earnings in an effortless manner. ## Key Functionalities of Trava Lending Pool\n* Deposit: Users can deposit their assets to Trava Pool to earn rewards with high APY and APR, which depend on the deposit/borrowing demand in the pool.\n * Borrow: When users want to use a type of asset to do business without selling their holding assets, they can deposit these available assets as collateral to borrow favorable assets.

Trava saw the problems that might hold the bullish growth of Lending projects and started to find the answer to it, which is to support as many assets as possible. The idea of supporting more assets led Trava to the thought that we need to support more users, which means we are product-oriented and user-oriented at the same time.\nWith a clear mission, the Trava Pool Creation is established. The function solves the current problems mentioned above by allowing projects and individuals to create and manage their own lending pools.

🧠 How Trava Calculates Credit Scores for Wallets

The credit scoring mechanism analyzes multiple dimensions of wallet activity to produce a numerical score that reflects the trustworthiness and reliability of the user.

⸻

📊 Key Factors in Credit Score Calculation

Category	Description
✅ Loan Repayment History	Timely and consistent repayment of borrowed assets positively affects your score.
✅ Collateral Usage	Healthy collateral ratios and avoiding close-to-liquidation levels are rewarded.
✅ Liquidation Events	Being liquidated reduces your credit score.
✅ Borrowing Frequency & Size	Regular, responsible borrowing builds a stronger credit history.
✅ DeFi Behavior Across Protocols	Trava may integrate external on-chain data to enhance scoring accuracy.
✅ Wallet Lifetime & Activity	Longer-term, stable wallets with more interactions are often scored higher.


⸻

🔍 Machine Learning Integration
	•	Trava uses AI/ML models to analyze behavioral patterns and predict risk.
	•	The system is designed to learn over time, improving its ability to distinguish between low- and high-risk users.
	•	This model helps enable under-collateralized or variable-rate lending in future Trava lending pools.

⸻

🧾 Example: What Might Affect Your Score

Wallet Behavior	Impact on Score
Repaying loans on time	👍 Positive
Frequently getting liquidated	👎 Negative
Supplying more collateral than required	👍 Positive
Opening multiple loans with high utilization	⚠️ Neutral to Negative depending on context
Long-term use of Trava and other DeFi platforms	👍 Positive


⸻

📌 Summary
	•	✅ Credit scores are calculated automatically and updated dynamically.
	•	🎯 Scores are wallet-specific and serve as a trust signal for Trava pools.
	•	🔐 Used for future support of under-collateralized loans or personalized loan terms.

⸻

Would you like a sample credit score simulation or suggestions on how to improve your score as a new user?","In Trava Finance, credit scores for wallet addresses are calculated using a combination of on-chain data, protocol interaction history, and AI-driven risk assessment models. While Trava does not assign a literal numeric “credit score” like FICO, it builds a dynamic risk profile for each wallet to assess how trustworthy and stable that address is as a borrower.

⸻

🧠 How Trava Calculates Credit Scores (Wallet Risk Profiles)

🔹 1. Borrowing & Repayment Behavior
	•	Repayment History: On-time repayments increase trust.
	•	Default or Liquidation Events: If your wallet was liquidated, that negatively impacts the score.
	•	Partial Repayments: Show proactive debt management and reduce risk.

⸻

🔹 2. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Usage
	•	The platform tracks how aggressively you borrow relative to your collateral.
	•	Safer users keep their health factor high (HF > 1.5).
	•	Risky users borrow close to liquidation thresholds (HF ≈ 1.0).

⸻

🔹 3. Collateral Quality & Diversity
	•	High-quality, low-volatility tokens (e.g., USDT, BUSD) improve your score.
	•	Using volatile or illiquid assets as collateral is seen as riskier.
	•	Collateral spread across multiple assets reduces systemic risk.

⸻

🔹 4. Historical Protocol Usage
	•	Longer history of lending, borrowing, and repaying builds a better reputation.
	•	Wallets that engage in spammy or exploit-like behavior are flagged.
	•	NFT-based lending is evaluated with NFT price volatility and liquidity data.

⸻

🔹 5. AI-Based Risk Modeling

Trava’s AI risk engine monitors behavioral patterns such as:
	•	Collateral value changes over time
	•	Reactions to market dips
	•	Borrow frequency and ratios across pools
	•	Correlation with bad-debt wallets (to avoid sybil attacks or flash loan exploits)

⸻

📊 Example Factors and Weights (Hypothetical)

Factor	Weight in Score
Repayment history	30%
Liquidation events	-25% (penalty)
Collateral volatility	-15%
Diversity of collateral	+10%
Loan duration vs. repayment	+10%
Health factor management	+15%

These weights are indicative — actual scoring uses AI models, not fixed formulas.

⸻

🔍 Where the Score Is Used
	•	To restrict or allow access to certain lending pools
	•	To adjust maximum borrow amounts dynamically
	•	To provide better interest rates to trustworthy borrowers (in custom pools)
	•	For risk-based analytics in the protocol’s backend

⸻

✅ How to Improve Your Wallet’s Credit Score

Action	Benefit
Repay loans early or on time	Boosts reliability
Keep health factor > 1.5	Avoids liquidation risk
Use stablecoins as collateral	Reduces perceived volatility
Avoid borrowing close to max limit	Shows responsible usage
Stay active and diversified	Builds a strong, long-term profile

⸻

Would you like a simulation of how a specific action (e.g. repaying a loan or being liquidated) affects your score numerically?","In Trava Finance, a user’s credit score (risk profile) is dynamically updated on-chain and/or via Trava’s off-chain AI engine based on real-time activity and historical behavior. It evolves with every key action you take on the protocol.

⸻

🔄 How Your Credit Score Gets Updated

✅ 1. Borrowing or Repayment Events
	•	Repaying loans on time → improves your creditworthiness
	•	Late or partial repayment → neutral or mildly positive
	•	Getting liquidated → negatively impacts your score

💡 Every loan you open or close influences your credit profile.

⸻

✅ 2. Health Factor Fluctuations
	•	Your Health Factor (HF) is constantly tracked:
	•	If HF consistently stays above 1.5, it’s seen as low risk
	•	If HF approaches 1.0 often, it’s flagged as high-risk behavior

⚠️ Even if you’re not liquidated, frequent close calls may degrade your score.

⸻

✅ 3. Collateral Volatility & Type
	•	Collateral is re-evaluated over time:
	•	Stablecoins (USDT, BUSD) → positive risk signal
	•	Volatile tokens (e.g., CAKE, meme coins) → riskier profile
	•	NFTs → creditworthiness depends on NFT value stability and liquidity

⸻

✅ 4. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio Monitoring
	•	The score updates as your borrowed amount / collateral value changes:
	•	Borrowing too close to your max limit → higher risk
	•	Keeping large unused borrowing capacity → safer user

⸻

✅ 5. AI-Based Behavior Tracking
	•	Trava’s AI analyzes:
	•	Frequency of borrowing/repaying
	•	Liquidation trends over time
	•	Asset correlations (e.g., if you’re part of exploit-like patterns)
	•	Reaction to market volatility (do you top up collateral or ignore?)

⸻

🔁 Update Triggers (Real-Time or Periodic)

Trigger Type	Score Updated When…
✅ On-chain event	You borrow, repay, get liquidated, or deposit
🕓 Periodic scan	AI models may re-evaluate based on behavior trends
✅ Risk threshold	Health factor or LTV breaches a defined limit
✅ Governance rule	Pools may apply updated scoring logic dynamically


⸻

📈 Where You Might See the Score Change

,How to increase my credit score?,"To increase your credit score on Trava Finance, you need to demonstrate responsible and consistent on-chain behavior — especially around lending and borrowing. Trava’s credit scoring system is designed to reward trustworthy users with better scores, potentially enabling more favorable loan terms in the future (such as under-collateralized borrowing).

Based on the official documentation, here’s how to improve your score:

⸻

📈 How to Increase Your Credit Score on Trava

✅ 1. Repay Loans On Time
	•	Always repay borrowed assets fully and promptly.
	•	Even partial repayments help demonstrate responsibility.
	•	Late or missed repayments can reduce your score.

⸻

✅ 2. Maintain a Safe Health Factor
	•	Keep your Health Factor well above 1.0 (preferably >1.5).
	•	This shows you manage risk well and reduces chances of liquidation.

⸻

✅ 3. Avoid Liquidation
	•	Being liquidated (due to a drop in collateral value or over-borrowing) has a negative impact on your score.
	•	Monitor your position regularly and top up collateral if needed.

⸻

✅ 4. Borrow Responsibly
	•	Don’t max out your borrowing limit — leave a safe margin.
	•	Repeated responsible borrowing improves your long-term credit profile.

⸻

✅ 5. Use the Protocol Regularly
	•	Trava may reward active, long-term users.
	•	A consistent history of borrowing, repaying, and collateral management boosts your reputation.

⸻

✅ 6. Diversify Your Activity
	•	Supply and borrow across multiple assets and pools (if available).
	•	This can show you’re a sophisticated and engaged user.

⸻

📌 Summary Table

Action	Effect on Score

Trava’s credit scoring system uses AI and on-chain data to evaluate trustworthiness, so your actions are continuously monitored and scored.

⸻

✅ Top Strategies to Increase Your Trava Credit Score

⸻

1. 💸 Repay Loans On Time (or Early)
	•	Timely repayment shows you’re a reliable borrower.
	•	Early repayment can further reduce your perceived risk.
	•	Avoid leaving long-term outstanding loans near the limit.

🟢 Positive impact: Builds trust and lowers default risk.

⸻

2. 📉 Maintain a Healthy Health Factor
	•	Keep your Health Factor > 1.5 (ideally > 2.0).
	•	This shows you’re not borrowing aggressively against your collateral.

🛡️ Example: If you can borrow $1,000, only use $500–600 max.

⸻

3. 🏦 Use Stable and High-Quality Collateral
	•	Deposit stablecoins (USDT, BUSD) or blue-chip assets (BNB, ETH) as collateral.
	•	Avoid volatile or illiquid tokens unless needed.

✅ Stable collateral = lower risk = higher score.

⸻

4. 🔁 Repay or Reduce Risky Loans
	•	Pay off small or near-liquidation loans.
	•	Consolidate borrowings into low-risk positions.

🔽 Less debt = less risk to the protocol.

⸻

5. 🔄 Top Up Collateral During Market Dips
	•	When crypto prices drop, add more collateral to keep your loan safe.
	•	Shows active and responsible risk management.

💡 Trava’s AI rewards proactive behavior, not just results.

⸻

6. 📊 Diversify Your Collateral
	•	Use multiple tokens or NFT assets instead of concentrating all value in one.
	•	Trava may view a diversified wallet as less vulnerable to single-asset crashes.

⸻

7. 🧠 Avoid Liquidation at All Costs
	•	One liquidation event can sharply reduce your credit score.
	•	Set alerts or monitor your dashboard regularly.

❌ Liquidation = major negative mark on your profile.

⸻

8. 🕒 Maintain Consistent Borrowing History
	•	Having a long-term pattern of borrowing and repaying steadily improves your credit reputation.

📈 Just like a real-world credit score: consistency builds trust.

⸻

📈 Summary Table: Actions That Improve Credit Score

Action	Impact	Notes
Repay loans early/on time	🔼 Strong	Most reliable way to gain trust
Keep health factor > 1.5	🔼 Moderate	Avoids risk of liquidation
Use stable collateral	🔼 Moderate	Less price fluctuation = safer
Avoid getting liquidated	🔽 Severe	Significantly damages score
Add collateral when prices drop	🔼 Smart	AI may reward this behavior
Diversify assets	🔼 Moderate	Reduces systemic risk

,Why did my credit score decrease?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, your credit score may decrease due to behaviors or events that increase your perceived risk as a borrower or protocol participant. The score is dynamic and reflects on-chain activity associated with your wallet.

⸻

❌ Common Reasons Your Credit Score May Decrease

1. 🚨 Loan Liquidation
	•	If your position was liquidated (i.e., your Health Factor dropped below 1), your score will decrease.
	•	Liquidation indicates poor risk management and damages your on-chain credit reputation.

⸻

2. ⏰ Late or Missed Repayments
	•	Although Trava loans accrue interest continuously, a long delay in repayment or ignoring growing debt may negatively impact your score.

⸻

3. ⚠️ Low Health Factor
	•	Keeping your position close to the liquidation threshold (e.g., Health Factor ≈ 1.0) over time shows risky behavior.
	•	Even if not liquidated, this can lower your trust score.

⸻

4. 📉 Over-Borrowing or High Utilization
	•	Continuously borrowing near your maximum borrow limit (based on your collateral) without proper management can reflect poorly.
	•	Over-leveraged accounts are considered higher risk.

⸻

5. ❄️ Inactivity After Borrowing
	•	If you borrow and leave the loan unmonitored or without interaction for a long time, the scoring system may treat it as neglect.

⸻

6. 🔁 Frequent Risky Actions
	•	Repeatedly:
	•	Borrowing just below safe limits
	•	Ignoring pool risk signals
	•	Withdrawing collateral without rebalancing the loan
can result in a cumulative drop in score.

⸻

📌 How to Check & Recover

Action	Recommendation
Check recent activity	Go to Trava Station and review borrow history
Raise health factor	Add collateral or repay debt
Repay overdue loans	Improves your score over time
Avoid future liquidations	Monitor price movements regularly
Use pools with safer parameters	Lower risk = better credit reputation


⸻

Would you like help analyzing your credit score history or building a recovery strategy to increase it again?","Your credit score (risk profile) on Trava Finance may have decreased due to one or more risky actions or changes detected by Trava’s on-chain and AI-based risk monitoring system. Here’s a breakdown of common reasons your score could drop:

⸻

❌ Top Reasons Your Credit Score Decreased on Trava

1. 💥 You Were Liquidated
	•	If your health factor dropped below 1.0, your position was likely liquidated.
	•	Even one liquidation negatively impacts your score significantly.
	•	It’s treated as a major default event.

⸻

2. 📉 Collateral Value Dropped
	•	If your collateral token lost value (e.g., BNB or an NFT crashed), your health factor also dropped.
	•	Even if you weren’t liquidated, a low collateral-to-debt ratio signals higher risk.

⸻

3. ⚠️ Borrowed Too Close to the Limit
	•	If you borrowed 90–100% of your borrowing capacity, your health factor hovered near 1.0.
	•	This risky behavior is flagged by Trava’s AI, even without liquidation.

⸻

4. 🕒 Loan Outstanding for Too Long
	•	Long-term borrowing without any partial repayments may trigger a negative update.
	•	Trava may assume higher risk if no action is taken over time.

⸻

5. 🧮 Used Risky or Volatile Collateral
	•	If you used highly volatile tokens or NFTs as collateral, your profile may be downgraded.
	•	These assets carry unpredictable price swings, which affect repayment confidence.

⸻

6. 📊 Single-Asset Exposure
	•	If your collateral was concentrated in just one token or NFT collection, it increases risk.
	•	Lack of diversification can lead to sudden score drops when that asset weakens.

⸻

7. 🔍 Protocol-wide Risk Updates
	•	Trava may update risk models based on market volatility or new data.
	•	This can cause score recalibration across all wallets — even without your direct action.

⸻

📉 Summary: Why Your Score Dropped

Reason	Description
❌ Liquidation	Major event that reduces trust sharply
⚠️ Low Health Factor	Indicates high risk of future liquidation
📉 Falling collateral prices	Increases likelihood of default
💸 Over-borrowing	Using full borrow limit = high risk
🕒 Stagnant loan + no activity	Viewed as passive or disengaged behavior
📊 Risky assets or low diversity	Reduces your risk-adjusted score


⸻

✅ What You Can Do Now

Action	Recovery Impact
Repay debt (even partially)	Improves trust
Add collateral to improve health	Raises borrowing buffer
Avoid volatile assets as collateral	Stabilizes your profile
Maintain > 1.5 Health Factor	Signals low-risk usage
Stay active and repay consistently	Slowly rebuilds score

For instance, you should increase your wallet balance with prestige coins and tokens, perform more transactions and become more active in the crypto market, maintaining good Loan-to-balance and Loan-to-investment ratios, supply more liquidity to lending pools, trade on lending DApps to earn as much profit as you can, avoid collateral liquidation while borrowing, and possess at least $1000 valuable token (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, or BNB).\nBesides, you need to be credible users for a long time. It is because to avoid fraud, TRAVA calculates some credit score parameters based on their average values in the last k days, where k depends on the volatility of the crypto market.

""content"": ""Rules
Auction is ONLY cancellable when it has NO BIDS. After the first bid comes in, neither you nor we can cancel it, as rules are written in the smart contract.
When the bidding countdown is less than 5 minutes left, every new bid will extend the countdown by 5 minutes;
Each bid price will be increased by at least 5% of the previous one. Once the countdown ends, the auction item will be obtained by the last/highest bidder;
The most important rule: 2.5% of the price increase for each bid is distributed to the previous bidder, and the remaining 97.5% would be the income of the auction publisher if it’s the last bid or returned to the bidder when it’s outbid.
With the rules, each bidder would either take the 5% share of the next bid or obtain the auction Knight with the price he/she offered. And the first bidder will additionally be free from distributing his/her own 5% to other people.
Note: The percentage that the later bidder pays for the earlier bidder is the same as the percentage that the sellers need to pay for the platform. So, 2.5% is also the amount auction publishers pay to the marketplace, which means that after receiving 97.5% of the final bidding price as income, sellers need to pay 2.5% of the income to the NFT marketplace.
Therefore, the final payment rate that the sellers receive is 95.06% of the final bid. This fee is utilized for marketing, operating, and functioning.
Seller (Auction Publishers)
First Bidders
Other Bidders
Last Bidder
Receive: ~95.06% of the final bidding price
Receive:
100% of his/her bidding capital
2,5% of the later bidding price
Receive:
2.5% of the later bidding price
97.5% of his/her bidding capital
Pay: the final bidding price
For example,
First, Alice offered a 1000 TRAVA bid in a new auction.
Secondly, Billy offered 1100 TRAVA
⇒ Alice would receive her own 1000 TRAVA and 2.5% of 1100 TRAVA, which would be 1027.5 TRAVA in total, and the extra 27.5 TRAVA is totally free money.
Finally, Michael offered 1200 TRAVA.
⇒ Then, Billy would get 97.5% of his 1100 TRAVA and 2.5% of 1200 TRAVA, that is 1102.5 TRAVA, still getting 30 TRAVA for free.
⇒ The auction publisher will receive ~ 95.06% of the final bidding price (1200 TRAVA). Therefore, the seller will receive ~ 1140.72 TRAVA and pay 29.25 TRAVA to the platform.

Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract. ##\n**How does Trava price NFTs?**\nTrava will provide the auction function for NFT assets. Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way. We also avoid the price fluctuation of NFT because the NFTs have been priced in the auction contract before. ##\n**What can I do with NFTs after the auction?**\nTRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT.\nMeanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.\nPreviousTrava Credit ScoreNextListing\nLast updated 2 years ago\nWas this helpful?"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/faq/nfts"", ""rrf_score"": 0.14583333333333331 }, { ""content"": ""##\n**Trava NFT Auction**\nComing soon"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/nfts/future-scope"", ""rrf_score"": 0.13333333333333333 }, { ""content"": ""NFT has become an increasingly popular way to buy and sell digital artwork. They are non-fungible, which naturally means that they are illiquid. Bringing liquidity to the NFT space would unlock a myriad of possibilities. As of May 2021, there have been no lending projects that make use of NFT as collaterals, because unlike a fungible currency or common stock, NFT value is difficult to determine. TRAVA.FINANCE adds more flexibility to the illiquid world of NFT and allows NFT owners to earn an ROI without selling it.\nTRAVA.FINANCE offers an innovative feature that prices NFTs based on auctions. After the auction, borrowers can use their NFTs as collateral. TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT. Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.\nThe auction process is as follows:\n 1. The NFT owner opens an auction session; she sets (i) the legal crypto used in the auction, (ii) the initial price for her NFT, (iii) the countdown time for the auction session, (iv) the mode for her auction (i.e., _auction-to-sell or auction-for-buy-right_), and other auction terms.\n 2. TRAVA.FINANCE users, who are interested in the NFT, can join in the auction session. To encourage users to participate in auctions, at the end of the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE randomly selects several bidders and rewards them with TRAVA tokens extracted from the auction fees. To guarantee that the bidders make their payment when they win the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE locks a number of their TRAVA tokens as soon as they join in the auction session and make a bid. When the auction finishes, they will immediately get their tokens back if they are not the winner. In case they are the winners, they can get their tokens back only if they pay for the auctioning NFT before the deadline.\n 3. In the _auction-to-sell_ mode, the auction winner will pay the owner the whole auction price to get the NFT.\n 4. In the _auction-for-buy-right_ mode, the auction winners have to pay a part of the auction price. We name the quotient of the amount the winners have to pay over the auction price \""_auction-paid ratio_ ”. The auction-paid ratio is calculated from the creditworthiness of the lender, borrower, NFT, and the auction terms. The NFT owners can use the cryptos paid by the auction winner as collateral for their loans. Once they repay their loan including the interest to the auction winners, they can get the NFT back. Otherwise, they will lose their NFT to the auction winners. These rules are all defined in the auction smart contract.\n\n\nTRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below.\n * **NFT owners** can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it. TRAVA.FINANCE thus increases the liquidity of NFTs and opens up a unique and exciting NFTFi marketplace.\n * Based on the given number of auction bids, **bidders** have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session. This rewarding mechanism provides incentives for users to actively make a bid in the auction.\n * **Auction winners** can get their desired NFT at a price lower than their bidding price (once NFT owners cannot repay the loan) or they can receive considerable interest from their loan to NFT owners (once NFT owners repay the loans and get their NFT back).\n * The credit scores of **NFT owners, auction winners, bidders,** and **NFTs** can be improved after auctions.\n\n\nThe auction mechanism for NFT can also be applied to any type of digital asset.

""content"": ""Benefit for those who participate in the Trava Knight auction
Benefit for auction publishers (the sellers)
Auction publishers (or sellers) are those who open auctions for their Knights. Opening an auction allows auction publishers to set up their price floor for their Knights, which determines their minimum desired price, helping them avoid selling their Knights at an unwanted low price compared to the market price.
The auction opens a great opportunity for Knight owners to make profits without the need of disassembling their Knights to pieces and selling each item multiple times, which can cause wasted gas fees due to multiple transactions.
Benefit for bidders
Trava Knight auction is of benefit for bidders since it offers them the opportunity to get the full Knight, not every piece of armoury NFT on Trava NFT Marketplace. This helps bidders save more time in obtaining a Knight without finding and collecting armoury items to assemble.
The auction also offers bidders an excellent method to get their favorable Knights, which suits their needs for missions such as Farming, Expedition, Farming with EXP and PvP tournaments in the future.
Benefit for Trava Lending Pool
The NFT Auction is the first step toward Trava Finance’s long-term aim of allowing NFTs to be used as collateral in the Trava Lending pool.

Each of Knight and Armory NFTs represents a unique digital collectible that can be bought, sold, rented and put on auction on Trava Knight NFT Marketplace. It helps increase the utility of not only NFTs for NFT-collateralization, but also $TRAVA in our system as all the trading on the Marketplace is in $TRAVA.
Users can assemble Knight NFTs to join Trava Farming Programs (NFT Farming, Heuristic Farming) in different vaults for a great APY — the rarer the NFT, the higher APY. The longer staked in the vaults, Loyal Knight NFT holders will also have more benefits in our lending pool in the future.
In addition, you can get rewards from Trava Knight NFTs by playing the Battle Hand Mini-Game, and joining in Missions such as Expedition or Treasure Map.

They are non-fungible, which naturally means that they are illiquid. Bringing liquidity to the NFT space would unlock a myriad of possibilities. As of May 2021, there have been no lending projects that make use of NFT as collaterals, because unlike a fungible currency or common stock, NFT value is difficult to determine. TRAVA.FINANCE adds more flexibility to the illiquid world of NFT and allows NFT owners to earn an ROI without selling it.\nTRAVA.FINANCE offers an innovative feature that prices NFTs based on auctions. After the auction, borrowers can use their NFTs as collateral. TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT. Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.\nThe auction process is as follows:\n 1. The NFT owner opens an auction session; she sets (i) the legal crypto used in the auction, (ii) the initial price for her NFT, (iii) the countdown time for the auction session, (iv) the mode for her auction (i.e., _auction-to-sell or auction-for-buy-right_), and other auction terms.\n 2. TRAVA.FINANCE users, who are interested in the NFT, can join in the auction session. To encourage users to participate in auctions, at the end of the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE randomly selects several bidders and rewards them with TRAVA tokens extracted from the auction fees. To guarantee that the bidders make their payment when they win the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE locks a number of their TRAVA tokens as soon as they join in the auction session and make a bid. When the auction finishes, they will immediately get their tokens back if they are not the winner. In case they are the winners, they can get their tokens back only if they pay for the auctioning NFT before the deadline.\n 3. In the _auction-to-sell_ mode, the auction winner will pay the owner the whole auction price to get the NFT.\n 4. In the _auction-for-buy-right_ mode, the auction winners have to pay a part of the auction price. We name the quotient of the amount the winners have to pay over the auction price \""_auction-paid ratio_ ”. The auction-paid ratio is calculated from the creditworthiness of the lender, borrower, NFT, and the auction terms. The NFT owners can use the cryptos paid by the auction winner as collateral for their loans. Once they repay their loan including the interest to the auction winners, they can get the NFT back. Otherwise, they will lose their NFT to the auction winners. These rules are all defined in the auction smart contract.\n\n\nTRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below.\n * **NFT owners** can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it.

The most important rule: **2.5%** of the price increase for each bid is distributed to the previous bidder, and the remaining **97.5%** would be the income of the auction publisher if it’s the last bid or returned to the bidder when it’s outbid.\n\n\nWith the rules, each bidder would either take the 5% share of the next bid or obtain the auction Knight with the price he/she offered. And the first bidder will additionally be free from distributing his/her own 5% to other people.\n_Note: The percentage that the later bidder pays for the earlier bidder is the same as the percentage that the sellers need to pay for the platform. So, 2.5% is also the amount auction publishers pay to the marketplace, which means that after receiving 97.5% of the final bidding price as income, sellers need to pay 2.5% of the income to the NFT marketplace._\n_Therefore, the final payment rate that the sellers receive is 95.06% of the final bid.

Opening an auction allows auction publishers to set up their price floor for their Knights, which determines their minimum desired price, helping them avoid selling their Knights at an unwanted low price compared to the market price. The auction opens a great opportunity for Knight owners to make profits without the need of disassembling their Knights to pieces and selling each item multiple times, which can cause wasted gas fees due to multiple transactions. Benefit for bidders Trava Knight auction is of benefit for bidders since it offers them the opportunity to get the full Knight, not every piece of armoury NFT on Trava NFT Marketplace. This helps bidders save more time in obtaining a Knight without finding and collecting armoury items to assemble. The auction also offers bidders an excellent method to get their favorable Knights, which suits their needs for missions such as Farming, Expedition, Farming with EXP and PvP tournaments in the future.

</PROMPT GENERAL AGENT>",What does Transmutation do and how can i execute it?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, Transmutation is a unique feature in Trava’s GameFi ecosystem that allows users to combine multiple NFTs (specifically Armoury items) to create a new, potentially more powerful or rare item.

⸻

🧪 What Is Transmutation in Trava?

Transmutation is the process of fusing several existing NFTs (e.g. weapons, armor, accessories from Armoury Chests) into a single upgraded NFT. It is similar to “crafting” or “item forging” in games.

⸻

🎯 Purpose of Transmutation

Objective	Benefit
Upgrade gear quality	Combine lower-tier items to obtain a higher-tier item
Reduce inventory clutter	Burn unwanted duplicates in exchange for better gear
Increase battle effectiveness	Create items with stronger attributes for use with Trava Knights
Enable strategic crafting	Tailor NFTs to your game strategy or resale goals


⸻

🛠️ How to Execute a Transmutation

✅ 1. Visit Trava Station

Go to: https://station.trava.finance

✅ 2. Connect Your Wallet

Ensure you’re on the BNB Chain, and that your wallet holds Armoury NFTs.

✅ 3. Navigate to “Transmutation” Section

From the main menu, click on “Transmutation” (usually under the GameFi or NFT tab).

✅ 4. Select Items to Fuse
	•	Choose multiple items of the same type and tier (e.g. 3 common swords)
	•	The system will show the possible outcome (e.g. a rare sword)

✅ 5. Confirm Transmutation
	•	Click “Transmute”
	•	Approve the transaction in your wallet
	•	The selected NFTs will be burned, and a new item NFT will be minted to your wallet

⸻

⚠️ Important Notes

Rule	Detail
🔄 Items are burned	Transmuted items are permanently destroyed
🎲 Outcome is not guaranteed	Higher rarity is likely but not 100%
💰 Gas fee applies	You’ll need some BNB to cover the transaction
🔗 NFT returned to your wallet	New item will appear in your NFT inventory


⸻

📌 Summary

Feature	Description
Purpose	Fuse lower-tier NFTs to create a higher-tier one
Input	Multiple same-type Armoury items
Output	1 upgraded item with higher rarity or stats
Location	station.trava.finance → Transmutation
Result	Strengthened NFT for GameFi or resale


⸻

Would you like a step-by-step example with screenshots or a rarity chart to understand your upgrade odds?","In the Trava Finance ecosystem, Transmutation is a unique NFT utility feature that allows users to combine multiple lower-rarity equipment NFTs into a higher-rarity one. It’s like forging or evolving items in RPG games — but on-chain and backed by smart contracts.

⸻

🔮 What Is Transmutation?

Transmutation lets you:
	•	Burn multiple equipment NFTs (like Common or Rare items)
	•	Generate one new, higher-rarity NFT
	•	The result is a randomized upgraded item from the next rarity tier
	•	Helps reduce low-value clutter and adds strategic crafting utility to NFT ownership

⸻

🎯 Purpose of Transmutation

Goal	Description
🔼 Upgrade NFT Rarity	Turn lower-tier items into more powerful or valuable ones
💰 Increase Trading Value	Higher-tier NFTs may have better resale potential
🧪 Prepare for Future GameFi	Stronger equipment might give you advantages in staking or gameplay
♻️ Burn Mechanism	Controls supply of low-tier items and encourages marketplace activity


⸻

🛠️ How to Execute Transmutation

✅ Step-by-Step:
	1.	Go to the Trava App
🔗 https://app.trava.finance
	2.	Connect Your Wallet
	•	MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or other Web3-compatible wallet
	3.	Navigate to the “Armoury” or “Transmutation” Section
	•	You’ll see a list of your eligible equipment NFTs
	4.	Select Items for Transmutation
	•	Choose a specific number of NFTs of the same rarity tier (e.g., 3 Common items)
	•	Usually requires 3 or more items, depending on rarity level
	5.	Confirm Transmutation
	•	The selected NFTs will be burned
	•	One new, upgraded NFT will be minted into your wallet
	•	Requires a small gas fee (BNB)
	6.	Receive Your New Equipment NFT
	•	The rarity tier will increase (e.g., Common → Rare)
	•	Item type and visuals are randomized within that tier

⸻

🎁 Transmutation Example

Input NFTs	Result
3× Common Swords	1× Rare Weapon (randomized)
3× Rare Shields	1× Epic Shield (randomized)

The output is not guaranteed to be the same type (e.g., sword in, sword out), only the rarity tier increases.

⸻

⚠️ Important Notes

Tip	Why It Matters
Items are burned	Transmuted NFTs are permanently removed
Gas fee required	Transmutation is an on-chain transaction
Rarity upgrade is random	Output is not user-controlled (except rarity)
Use strategic timing	Transmuting during rarity events or quests may offer bonuses

	•	You can view your Knight’s EXP level directly from:
	•	https://app.trava.finance
	•	“My NFTs” or “Knight Inventory” section

🔄 EXP points accumulate over time — and may also decay if left unused in some seasonal systems.

🧠 Summary: All About EXP Points

Feature	Description
What it is	Experience system for Trava Knight NFTs
How it’s earned	Staking, quests, events, equipping, governance
What it does	Levels up Knights, boosts rewards, enables GameFi features
Where to track it	Trava App → Knight Profile
Why it matters	Competitive advantage, rare unlocks, higher APY

At the moment, EXP (Experience Point) is the point that shows how long an Armoury NFT is staked in our vaults. EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault.
Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault
We’ve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items).
You can see your EXP  either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace.



Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs. However, when you withdraw your Knight NFT, disassemble and reassemble with different items to get another Knight NFT, your Armoury NFTs will have different EXPs.

,What is Dilution Staking and its requirements ?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, Dilution Staking is a special staking mechanism designed to reduce the circulating supply of TRAVA tokens while offering rewards to long-term holders. It is part of Trava’s tokenomics and governance strategy, encouraging users to lock up their TRAVA in exchange for ecosystem benefits.

⸻

💠 What Is Dilution Staking?

Dilution Staking is a form of long-term, locked staking where users commit TRAVA tokens for a fixed period and receive:
	•	Governance power (veTRAVA)
	•	Staking rewards
	•	Protection against token dilution (i.e., reduced influence from newly unlocked tokens)

⸻

🎯 Purpose of Dilution Staking

Goal	Benefit
Reduce liquid supply	Helps support TRAVA token price stability
Reward committed holders	Incentivizes long-term alignment
Boost governance participation	Locked tokens grant veTRAVA for voting rights
Strengthen protocol loyalty	Filters short-term speculation


⸻

✅ Key Requirements for Dilution Staking

Requirement	Description
🔐 TRAVA tokens	You must hold TRAVA to participate
📆 Lock-in period	You choose a fixed staking duration (e.g., 3 months to 4 years)
🧾 Smart contract lock	Tokens are non-withdrawable until the end of the period
💡 veTRAVA minted	Based on amount and duration, you receive veTRAVA (vote-escrowed TRAVA)

The longer the lock-up, the more veTRAVA you receive, increasing your governance influence and staking rewards.

⸻

📈 What You Get from Dilution Staking

Reward Type	Details
🎖️ veTRAVA	Vote in governance proposals and DAO initiatives
💰 Staking rewards	Earn yield from protocol revenues or emissions
🛡️ Anti-dilution protection	Maintain influence as token supply inflates


⸻

🔄 How to Participate
	1.	Go to Trava Station
	2.	Navigate to “Staking → Dilution Staking”
	3.	Connect your wallet (on BNB Chain)
	4.	Choose:
	•	Amount of TRAVA to stake
	•	Lock-up duration
	5.	Confirm the transaction → You receive veTRAVA

⸻

⚠️ Important Notes
	•	You cannot withdraw early
	•	Your veTRAVA decays over time until the unlock date
	•	You can re-stake or extend the lock to maintain your veTRAVA level

⸻

Would you like a calculator to estimate how much veTRAVA you’d receive based on your TRAVA amount and lock time?","Dilution Staking is a unique staking mechanism within the Trava Finance ecosystem that allows users to stake their Trava Knight NFTs to earn TRAVA token rewards and EXP (Experience Points) over time. What makes it different is the “dilution” factor — your share of rewards depends not only on your stake, but also on how many other users are staking at the same time.

⸻

🧠 What Is Dilution Staking?

It’s a staking pool designed to:

Feature	Description
🎯 Distribute TRAVA rewards	Knight holders earn TRAVA tokens for staking their NFTs
🧠 Grant EXP points	Knights also gain EXP to level up
📉 Dilute rewards over time	The more Knights staked, the less each one earns proportionally
🏆 Reward long-term holders	Staking early or for longer periods offers better relative returns


⸻

🧪 Why “Dilution”?
	•	The reward pool is fixed per period (e.g., weekly or monthly)
	•	Your reward = (Your Knight’s weight / Total pool weight) × Reward pool
	•	If more users stake Knights, your per-Knight reward gets diluted
	•	This incentivizes:
	•	Early staking
	•	Strategic timing
	•	Holding rarer or higher-ranked Knights (with better weight)

⸻

✅ Requirements to Join Dilution Staking

Requirement	Details
🧙 Own a Trava Knight NFT	Only Knight NFTs are eligible — not general equipment NFTs
🌐 Wallet on BNB Chain	Connect MetaMask or Web3 wallet on BNB Smart Chain
💰 Pay small gas fees	Needed to stake, unstake, and claim rewards (in BNB)
🛡️ Optional: Equip Items	Some Armoury items may boost EXP gain or Knight weight


⸻

🔁 How to Participate

Step-by-Step:
	1.	Go to: https://app.trava.finance
	2.	Navigate to “Staking → Dilution Staking”
	3.	Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
	4.	Select the Knight(s) you want to stake
	5.	Click “Stake”, approve the transaction
	6.	Your Knight starts earning TRAVA + EXP

⸻

📊 Factors That Affect Your Rewards

Factor	Impact on Rewards
🧱 Knight Rarity	Rarer Knights may have higher base staking weight
🧪 Pool Size	More Knights = more dilution = less per NFT
⏳ Staking Duration	Longer staking may boost EXP or unlock bonuses
⚔️ Equipped Items	Certain items may enhance staking weight or yield


⸻

🧠 Summary: Dilution Staking in Trava

Category	Details
What it is	NFT staking pool for Trava Knights
What you earn	TRAVA tokens + EXP points
Why “dilution”?	Rewards shrink as more Knights enter the pool
Requirements	Knight NFT, BNB wallet, gas fees
Strategy	Stake early, hold rare Knights, minimize overlap

""content"": ""There are six salient features of TRAVA.FINANCE, including:
Crypto lending marketplace: TRAVA.FINANCE creates a marketplace in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and obtain greater earnings.
Semantic knowledge graph: TRAVA.FINANCE is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA.FINANCE to efficiently search for useful information such as (i) the amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses; (ii) the provenance of an NFT; (iii) aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc.
Data analysis: To reduce lending risks, TRAVA.FINANCE performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA.FINANCE recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, Loan to Value ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA.FINANCE also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools.
Credit score evaluation: Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can (i) reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool; and (ii) stimulate borrowing by defining a high Loan to Value ratio for borrowers with high credit scores.
Cross-chain identification and cross-chain lending: TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross- chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores.
NFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals: To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA.FINANCE allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn considerable amounts from the contract.

While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrowing/lending interest rate, liquidity threshold, Loan to Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA.FINANCE offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA.FINANCE is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks.\nThe pool owners, who are an additional role to lenders and borrowers, can receive more earnings by devising a good lending strategy for their pools.

,How does TRAVA.FINANCE incentivize validators to update the knowledge graph?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, validators are incentivized to update the knowledge graph through a reward mechanism that compensates them with TRAVA tokens for their contributions to the ecosystem.

⸻

🔍 What Is the Knowledge Graph in Trava?

The Knowledge Graph is a dynamic data structure within the Trava protocol that represents:
	•	Relationships between user addresses
	•	On-chain behaviors
	•	Risk profiles and credit-related data

It is a core part of Trava’s credit scoring and risk evaluation engine, especially as the platform expands its DeFi + GameFi intelligence.

⸻

💸 How Validators Are Incentivized

✅ 1. Reward in TRAVA Tokens
	•	Validators who accurately and timely update the knowledge graph receive TRAVA token rewards.
	•	This ensures the graph remains up-to-date, improving credit scoring and risk prediction accuracy.

⸻

⚙️ 2. Performance-Based Incentives
	•	Rewards may be weighted by the quality or importance of the updates:
	•	More accurate or high-impact updates = higher rewards
	•	Spam or low-quality contributions may be ignored or penalized

⸻

🧠 3. Decentralized Contribution
	•	The system is designed to allow multiple validators to contribute in a permissionless or delegated model.
	•	Over time, this supports decentralized intelligence building across the Trava ecosystem.

⸻

🔐 4. Anti-Gaming Measures
	•	Validators may be required to stake TRAVA to participate, ensuring they have skin in the game.
	•	False or manipulative updates may result in penalties or slashing (if staking is used).

⸻

🧾 Summary Table

Aspect	Description
🎯 Task	Update and maintain knowledge graph accuracy
💰 Reward	TRAVA tokens
🧠 Value to Protocol	Improves credit scoring and trustworthiness
⚠️ Quality Control	Performance and integrity affect reward levels
🛡️ Optional Staking	May be required to discourage malicious updates


⸻

Would you like help modeling how this validator system could be integrated into a dApp, or see how knowledge graph data impacts a user’s credit score?","As of now, Trava Finance does not operate a blockchain or network that uses validators in the traditional proof-of-stake sense, nor does it directly utilize a knowledge graph maintained by validators in the way that some semantic or oracle-based projects (like The Graph or Chainlink) might.

However, if your question refers to how Trava might incentivize participants (oracles, evaluators, or off-chain agents) to update or contribute to risk models, NFT valuations, or pool intelligence, then here’s how Trava encourages decentralized data contribution and accuracy:

⸻

🧠 1. Risk Assessment + Valuation Layer (AI-Assisted)

Trava uses AI models and potentially third-party valuation oracles to:
	•	Appraise NFT values for collateral use
	•	Assess borrower risk profiles
	•	Recalculate pool-level risk in real time

While not called “validators,” Trava may rely on:
	•	External data sources
	•	Community-voted mechanisms for approving valuation models or risk scoring methods

Incentives may include TRAVA token rewards, or governance voting rights for those who maintain accurate data inputs or improve models.

⸻

🧩 2. Community Governance & DAO Participation

TRAVA token holders play a validator-like role in:
	•	Proposing or voting on how pools are managed
	•	Approving new token listings or collateral settings
	•	Suggesting upgrades to the NFT valuation algorithm or rules

Governance participants are incentivized through staking and voting rewards. This aligns their incentives with accurate, decentralized decision-making — similar to how “validators” ensure trust in a network.

⸻

🧪 3. Reputation & EXP in Gamified Systems

In the NFT and staking ecosystem:
	•	Users who stake Knights, complete quests, or contribute to ecosystem activities earn EXP points, item drops, or TRAVA rewards.
	•	Some of these actions may indirectly support knowledge updates (e.g., transmuting or auctioning NFTs helps define their true value).

⸻

📍 To Clarify: No Native Knowledge Graph Validators
	•	Trava does not use a validator network to maintain a decentralized knowledge graph like The Graph Protocol.
	•	But it does incentivize accurate data interaction through:
	•	AI model integration
	•	Governance-driven protocols
	•	Token reward mechanisms

⸻

🧠 Summary

Mechanism	Validator-like Role	Incentive Type
Risk & NFT Appraisers	Provide accurate value input	TRAVA rewards (direct or DAO)
Governance voters	Update pool/risk configurations	Staking + voting incentives
NFT players / stakers	Influence EXP, rarity, utility	EXP points + NFT utility

""content"": ""Validators must update the knowledge graph regularly, otherwise, they will be stripped of their validator role, and cannot earn rewards for appending new blocks or verifying transactions.”
“Each time enriching the knowledge graph, validators will gain the fame score, thereby gaining more priorities and indirectly having the opportunity to earn more TRAVA.FINANCE coins when joining the network.”
“Priorities may include voting power or the privilege to unlock TRAVA.FINANCE tokens earlier than the standard time when receiving awards.

      ""content"": ""Figure 3: An example of the cross-chain knowledge graph\nThe knowledge graph is one of the most fundamental components of TRAVA.FINANCE, which is responsible for storing and representing aggregated data from multiple blockchain networks. The graph and TRAVA.FINANCE protocols make independent blockchains interconnected and create the internet of hyper-linked blockchains, allowing DApps to address complex business in reality.\nFigure 3 shows an example of the knowledge graph. The circle represents an entity (or instance) of data such as a wallet address, a user, a lending pool, an NFT, or other types of digital assets. Each entity is associated with other entities in certain relationships, represented by directional arrows; the direction of an arrow is the direction of the relationship.\nThe white rectangles are the values for the data attributes of the entity. The example graph shows that the WalletAddress2 is on the Ethereum network and that address owns an NFT. Aggregated information of the NFT, such as the highest bid price, number of auctions, list of addresses ever owned, etc., are also represented in the knowledge graph.\nLet us assume that a user creates one address on the Bitcoin network and one address on the Ethereum network. Because there were no relationships among these addresses, the knowledge graph creates two anonymous users, i.e., AnonymousUser1 and AnonymousUser2. AnonymousUser1 owns the Bitcoin addresses (i.e., WalletAddress3), and AnonymousUser2 has one Ethereum address, i.e., WalletAddress1. Various information related to a wallet address is stored in the graph. For example, the WalletAddress3 entity contains the _average balance_ , the _total amount of ETHs transferred in and out_ , the _total number of transactions_ , or _the average, median, mode,_ and _highest number of ETHs transferred in one transaction._\nAssuming the user wants to increase his/her credit score or use up all of his/her cryptos as collateral for a loan, he or she can unify all addresses as one via the cross-chain identification protocol performed in only one TRAVA.FINANCE's transaction. After completing the transaction, the two anonymous users are linked by the _sameAs_ relationship.\nDepending on users’ needs, the cross-chain identification protocol also supports linking two wallet address entities by a _guarantee_ relationship. Once an address is lost, if all the addresses that guarantee the address confirm the loss, the address status will be claimed as _lost_ in the knowledge graph.\nWallet addresses can also be connected by a _transfer_ relationship. To ensure scalability, rather than detailed transactions, statistical and aggregated information on transactions is calculated and stored in that _transfer_ relationship. As in the knowledge graph example above, several remarkable pieces of information are saved, including _BlockchainAddress1 has transferred 400 ETHs in total to BlockchainAddress2; it is performed through 10 transactions, and the largest transaction transfers 200 ETHs._\nTo avoid junk addresses and junk digital assets, we do not store all blockchain entities in the knowledge graph. The number of transactions or the maximum of cryptos transferred in one transaction related to an NFT or an address needs to surpass a threshold so that the NFT and the address will be added to the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph can also represent other types of entities, relationships, and properties. We develop a unified interface so that the expansion of the knowledge graph can be done in a logical, consistent, effective, scalable, and standardized manner.\nAs the knowledge graph plays a crucial role, it can only be updated by a TRAVA.FINANCE’s validator, and this must be agreed upon by other validators on the network. The knowledge graph needs to be infinitely extended while the assigned number of TRAVA.FINANCEs is fixed and finite. Thus it is not possible to pay fees for updating the graph. However, there should also be a way to encourage validators to update and enrich the knowledge graph. To reconcile this contradiction, TRAVA.FINANCE requires and also encourages validators to update the knowledge graph.\nOn the one hand, validators must update the knowledge graph regularly, otherwise, they will be stripped of their validator role, and cannot earn rewards for appending new blocks or verifying transactions. On the other hand, each time enriching the knowledge graph, validators will gain the fame score, thereby gaining more priorities and indirectly having the opportunity to earn more TRAVA.FINANCE coins when joining the network.\nPriorities may include voting power or the privilege to unlock TRAVA.FINANCE tokens earlier than the standard time when receiving awards. Enriching the graph is a special kind of TRAVA.FINANCE transaction that requires no fee. Out of all transactions, graph-related transactions are extracted and stored separately in files along with their hash value. This allows validators and other nodes to (re)construct the graph more efficiently with their own graph database systems.\nPreviousArchitectureNextCross-chain Identification\nLast updated 3 years ago\nWas this helpful?\n"",

,What steps does a user need to take to prove ownership of multiple wallet addresses?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, if a user wants to prove ownership of multiple wallet addresses (for example, to unify their credit history or gain better scores in Trava’s credit system), they must complete a signature-based verification process across all wallets.

⸻

✅ Steps to Prove Ownership of Multiple Wallet Addresses on Trava

🔐 1. Choose a Primary Wallet
	•	This will be your main identity wallet.
	•	All other wallets will be linked to this one as “verified secondary addresses.”

⸻

✍️ 2. Connect the Secondary Wallet
	•	Go to Trava Station
	•	Connect the secondary wallet (the one you want to prove you own)

⸻

✉️ 3. Sign a Message
	•	Trava will prompt you to sign a unique verification message with your secondary wallet.
	•	This message typically contains a nonce and a link to your primary wallet address.

✅ Signing the message does not cost gas and does not give Trava access to your funds — it simply proves ownership cryptographically.

⸻

🔗 4. Submit the Signature to Trava Protocol
	•	After signing, submit the signature via the platform (or API if used programmatically).
	•	This links the secondary address to your primary wallet in the Trava credit scoring system.

⸻

🔄 5. Repeat for Each Additional Wallet
	•	If you have more wallets to link, repeat steps 2–4 for each one.

⸻

📌 Why Link Wallets?

Benefit	Description
🧠 Unified Credit Profile	Combines lending/borrowing activity from multiple wallets
🎯 More Accurate Scoring	Improves your creditworthiness by consolidating history
🛡️ Proof of Ownership	Demonstrates you control all linked wallets securely
🚀 Easier ecosystem integration	Helpful in governance, reward tracking, GameFi progression


⸻

Would you like a step-by-step interface walkthrough or a template message for wallet signature verification?","To prove ownership of multiple wallet addresses, a user must demonstrate that they control the private keys to each of those addresses. The standard and secure way to do this in blockchain systems (including DeFi platforms like Trava Finance) is by performing cryptographic signing using each wallet.

⸻

✅ Step-by-Step: Proving Ownership of Multiple Wallet Addresses

🔹 1. Access All Wallets

Make sure you have access to all wallets you want to prove ownership of. These can be:
	•	MetaMask wallets
	•	Hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor)
	•	Mobile wallets (e.g., Trust Wallet)

⸻

🔹 2. Use a Signing Message

Each wallet must sign a unique or platform-specific message to prove control. The message might be:
	•	A random nonce (generated by the app)
	•	A specific text like ""I am proving ownership of this address for Trava Finance on [Date].""
	•	A challenge string from a backend or smart contract

This step is commonly implemented using eth_sign, personal_sign, or signMessage methods in Web3 libraries.

⸻

🔹 3. Sign Message from Each Wallet

You’ll need to:
	•	Connect each wallet to a DApp or signing interface
	•	Sign the designated message
	•	Return the signature and the original message

The platform (e.g., Trava Finance) can then verify the signature using the ecrecover function or equivalent to extract the signing address.

⸻

🔹 4. Submit Signed Proofs to the Platform

Typically, you submit:
	•	Your signed message
	•	The signature
	•	The wallet address being proven

This can be done via:
	•	Web3-enabled form on the Trava website
	•	API call if you’re a developer
	•	Discord/moderator submission (in informal cases)

⸻

🔹 5. Verification Logic

The backend or smart contract verifies:

Recovered address from signature == Submitted address

If this holds true for all submitted addresses, you’ve successfully proven ownership of all.

⸻

🧠 Why Is This Needed?

Use Case	Reason for Ownership Proof
Consolidating rewards	Claim TRAVA or NFT rewards across multiple wallets
Multi-wallet governance voting	Ensure voting weight isn’t misused
Cross-wallet staking	Link Knight NFTs or assets from multiple addresses
Sybil resistance	Prevent airdrop abuse or spam accounts


⸻

🛡️ Best Practices

Tip	Reason
Sign unique messages	Prevent signature replay attacks
Never share private keys	Only submit signatures — never expose private data
Use wallet UI or secure script	Don’t manually construct signatures unless experienced
Timestamp messages	Ensure freshness and prevent reuse later

""}]",,,"{ ""number_of_documents"": 5, ""results"": [ { ""content"": ""Figure 4: Cross-chain identification\nThe cross-chain identification protocol plays an important role in the TRAVA.FINANCE architecture. It can be used to verify that multiple addresses on different chains belong to the same user. The protocol allows TRAVA.FINANCE to provide an overview of anonymous users, including their total cryptos and other digital assets, statistics for their transactions, and their relationships with other blockchain addresses. These types of information and relationships are stored on the cross-chain knowledge graph. The protocol can (i) improve the credit score of the users and their wallet address so that they can get favorable interest rates, (ii) save them transaction fees since they can use up all of their cryptos as collateral in a single transaction, and (iii) allow them to get their cryptos back when they lose one of their wallet address.\nTo implement the protocol, we develop a wallet application so that users can manage their accounts and prove their ownership of multiple accounts. The application provides users with two functionalities: _“Add account”_ and _“Create a proof of ownership”._ Users can add a new account to the wallet application in multiple ways, e.g., (i) create an account, (ii) import a private key, and (iii) connect to a hardware wallet.\nTo foster their DeFi transactions, they might need to prove that they are the owner of n addresses. To this end, they can use our wallet application to perform a transaction that activates the cross-chain identification protocol. Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators check the accuracy of the data associated with the transaction. If the data is valid, the validators accept the transaction and write the **sameAs** relationship among the owners of the addresses to the knowledge graph.\nIn the following we describe our processing to verify the cross-chain identification of multiple wallet addresses. ####\nUser side\nAssume that a user would like to confirm her ownership for 3 accounts, the wallet creates a message containing 3 data elements, each includes a pair of a _chainId_ and a _public key_. Every element has a fixed size of 41 bytes: 8 bytes for the _chainId_ and 33 bytes for the _public key_. The data format is as follows:\n * data1 (41 bytes) := chainId1 (8 bytes) + pub1 (33 bytes)\n * data2 (41 bytes) := chainId2 (8 bytes) + pub2 (33 bytes)\n * data3 (41 bytes) := chainId3 (8 bytes) + pub3 (33 bytes)\n\n\nThe wallet uses the Merkle tree to hash the data and obtains the _rootHash_ (32 bytes)\n * rootHash := MerkleTree([data1,data2,data3]).getRoot()\n\n\nThe user then uses her 3 private keys to sign on the _rootHash_. Each signing creates a signature, named _si_ (64 bytes):\n * s1 := Sign(rootHash, prv1)\n * s2 := Sign(rootHash, prv2)\n * s3 := Sign(rootHash, prv3)\n\n\nFinally, a transaction is generated and broadcasted to validators. A sample of transaction payload is as follows:\n * Type (8 bytes): \""SameAs\""\n * Number (4 bytes): 3 // The number of addresses\n * Message (n*41 bytes): data1 data2 data3\n * Signatures (n*64 bytes): s1 s2 s3\n * Timestamp (8 bytes): 1619602364\n\n\nThe total size of a transaction to prove n accounts of the same user is: _20 + n * 105_ bytes ####\nValidator side\nReceiving the transaction, TRAVA validators verify the timestamp and then verify the signatures as follows. They first extract the message _{data1, … datan}_ and the list of signatures _{s1, … sn}_. From each data element _datai_ , the validators get the _chainId_ and the _public key_ (i.e., _pubi_). They use the Merkle tree to hash the data and regenerate the _rootHash_ :\n * rootHash := MerkleTree([data1, data2, data3]).getRoot()\n\n\nThe validators then use _pubi_ to verify signature _si_ on the rootHash:\n * verifySignature(rootHash, s1 , pub1) => valid/invalid\n * verifySignature(rootHash, s2 , pub1) => valid/invalid\n * verifySignature(rootHash, s3 , pub1) => valid/invalid\n\n\nOnce all signatures are valid, the validators agree that all accounts stored in the message belong to the same user. From n pairs of _chainId_ and _public key_ , the validators calculate the respective addresses of the user. To eliminate useless addresses, the validators perform additional checks on the age of the address, its average balance, or the total number of transactions related to the address. Finally, the validators store the _sameAs_ relationship among the valid addresses of the user on the knowledge graph.\nPreviousCross-chain Knowledge GraphNextCredit Score Evaluation\nLast updated 3 years ago\nWas this helpful?"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/cross-chain-identification"", ""rrf_score"": 0.16666666666666666 }, { ""content"": ""# Introduction To BRicher Auto Investing And Semi-auto Investing\nPublished in\n4 min readSep 16, 2022\nShare\nIntroduction to BRicher’s new functions\n _BRicher is a unique aggregator that composes multiple investment methods: providing liquidity, swapping, staking, depositing, and borrowing in the lending pools._\n_In summary, these composite strategies are automatically built so that users can get the most optimized one to maximize their profit.

While heading the new year — 2023 with more features, and utilities, let’s look back at the big picture of Trava Finance in 2022._\n \nA Glimpse of Trava Finance and the Trava Ecosystem\nTrava Finance is a DeFi protocol that aims to build the first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. Following that, besides the Trava Lending pool, Trava Finance will offer a flexible mechanism where users can create and manage their lending pools to start a lending business.\nThe ecosystem currently contains three main components, including Trava Lending pool, Trava Capital (TraDAO), and Trava Knight NFT, along with various supported features related to the semantic knowledge graph, data analytics, credit score evaluation, cross-chain identification, and cross-chain lending, etc.\n \nTrava Finance 2022 Milestones\n _Take a look at the critical achievements that we attained this year:_\nTrava Finance 2022 milestones\n \nTrava Finance 2022 Milestones\n _Take a look at the critical achievements that we attained this year:_\nTrava Finance 2022 milestones\n\nTrava Lending Pool\nAs the name suggests, Trava Lending Pool provides users with various lending services. In this case, users can deposit their tokens (there are above 15 assets supported) in the lending pools to get rewards with pretty high APY and APR. Besides that, they can also borrow assets from the lending pool by providing collaterals.\nIn 2022, multiple features related to the lending pool were implemented to maximize users’ experience:\n\n\nWith Trava Governance, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users a chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer the management decision completely to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project.\nGo along with that, Trava Governance Vault was implemented, allowing users to lock TRAVA and rTRAVA to gain rewards and voting power in the ecosystem.\nTrava Governance Empowerment\n\n\nFortune Mining is an important component of the Trava minigame series that encourage users to deposit into a special vault named Fortune Mining Vault. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm).\nThat means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones.\n \nTrava Finance 2022 Milestones\n _Take a look at the critical achievements that we attained this year:_\nTrava Finance 2022 milestones\n\nTrava Knight NFT\nTrava Knight NFT is one of the three key components in the Trava Ecosystem. It is the first step on our path to reaching our goal of NFT collateralization in our lending pool system.\nIn 2022, some critical features related to Trava Knight NFT have been opened.\n * **_Trava Knight NFT Auction_**\n\n\nNFT auction allows sellers and buyers to interact and agree on a price for the NFT that is being auctioned. In the Trava Knight NFT Auction, each NFT is evaluated clearly. These values will verify the position of Knight NFT in the Trava Lending Pool when NFT collateralization is available.\n * **_Trava Knight NFT Heuristic Farming_**\n\n\nBesides the five initial farming vaults, we provided five more vaults for Heuristic Farming that allows all Knights to participate in one or more vaults. Rewards from Heuristic Farming are rTRAVA tokens and EXP (one EXP for every 3 seconds in the vault). The higher EXP, the higher the APR, and the higher the rTRAVA reward.\n * **_Trava Knight NFT mini-game series_**\n\n\nTrava Knight NFT mini-game is a special game series that we open to optimize users’ experiences. The first minigame opened is The Battle Hand Mini-Game — a battle of wits inspired by a traditional game called Rock, Paper, Scissors. During the battle, Knight will have a chance to choose an appropriate action to compete with the competitor. The actions have the picture of each element in the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, and the rules are similar to the traditional game: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.\n * **_TOD Listing_**\n\n\nTOD is the native token of Trava Capital (rebranded from TraDAO). At the beginning of March 2022, we listed TOD on PancakeSwap and opened the Auto-compound staking and bonding mechanism.\nBond installment is a unique feature that allows bonders to buy more TOD with a certain amount of assets and pay the debt later. This type of bond offers users with small amounts of capital to obtain more bonds and then earn more profit from auto-compounding staking.\nSince May 2022, TraDAO protocol and the community have adjusted the strategy to adapt to the bad situation. However, the prolonged bear market caused the unstable development of several OHM forks, both big names and smaller ones, like TraDAO. That leads to the desire to make changes for the long-term development of the whole community. Following the community decision, we rebranded TraDAO to Trava Capital, which also means moving away from the OHM mechanism principle to approach the new model as venture capital.\n \nTrava Finance 2022 Milestones\n _Take a look at the critical achievements that we attained this year:_\nTrava Finance 2022 milestones\n\n**Analytics tools**\n _Besides these main products, Trava Finance provides users with various data analytics tools that support users in using not only Trava Finance products but making a reasonable investing decisions. One of them is BRicher._\n\n\nBRicher is a unique aggregator that composes multiple investment methods: providing liquidity, swapping, staking, depositing, and borrowing in the lending pools. These composite strategies are automatically built so that users can get the most optimized one to maximize their profit. Moreover, unlike other aggregators, BRicher lets investors own their tokens so that they can take complete control of capital and investment plans.\nTrava Finance ‘s new feature named — BRicher, an aggregator supporting users in their investing process\nAs a part of this inevitable wave, Trava Finance is now creating our own path as the first-ever protocol bringing a new type of asset in the form of a ticket — Trava Ticket. Going along with the idea, we develop a new generation of Tokenomics for NFT — Ticketomics, which includes max circulating supply and mint/burn mechanism.\nFollowing that, a ticket in Trava Finance is an exchangeable asset that allows users to own additional perks or access to products in the Trava Ecosystem. There are three types of tickets: Counter Ticket, Presale Ticket, and Incentive Ticket. Each has different usages, so that benefits users in different ways.\n \nCritical achievements in 2022\nThe support from the whole community leads us to critical achievements, take a look at what we have done and attained in the last 1 year:\nTrava achievements in 2022\n \nPartnership in 2022\n _Besides these achievements, it is grateful for us to build new relationships with various projects which play significant roles in supporting us in enriching the whole ecosystem._\nThis is an educational blog that provides readers, who are wise investors and knowledge-craved developers accurate information about the technology landscape, especially blockchain.\nFollowing the partnerships, TechFi and Trava Finance will leverage the background of both parties to tap into each other’s strengths and provide joint solutions related to technical support, business development, marketing and communication development, and academic support.\nRouter and Dfyn\nRouter Protocol and Dfyn are a true representation of the potential of cross-chain capable dApps. In order to further augment the extent of their interoperable functionalities and grow the capabilities of Trava Finance, we are thrilled to reveal the three-pronged strategic partnership that presents some key aspects: Trava Finance will integrate Router Widget, $TRAVA token is listed on the Router App, Dfyn will integrate Trava token health analytics. In addition, there are much more cooperation potentials that will bring mutual benefit given that both aim to enable cross-chain strategy.\nNFTb is one of the most secured LaunchPad platforms that allow artists to access DeFi opportunities while delivering the most outstanding user experience. By cooperating with NFTb, we opened a special presale ticket event.\n \nOur Community\nIn the very long journey we have been through, our community plays a key role in supporting us to attain critical achievements. In this one year, we appreciate the companions of the whole community and feel grateful that it’s expanding. That’s expressed in the increase in followers and members number on Medium, Twitter, Discord, and Telegram.\nTrava Finance community\nThank you so much for being with us through the good and bad times of this year. It’s the end of 2022, but the long journey is still ahead.

🛡️ Role of the Security Advisory Board (SAB) in Trava Governance

🔍 1. Review Governance Proposals for Security Risks
	•	The SAB is responsible for evaluating submitted governance proposals to detect:
	•	Smart contract vulnerabilities
	•	Economic exploits
	•	Malicious parameters or configurations
	•	This helps prevent governance attacks or changes that could harm the protocol or users.

⸻

⛔ 2. Power to Veto Harmful Proposals
	•	If a proposal is deemed malicious or dangerously flawed, the SAB has the authority to:
	•	Reject or delay the proposal before it proceeds to public voting
	•	Request revisions or clarifications

This acts as a security checkpoint to avoid protocol-breaking changes slipping through governance.

⸻

🧠 3. Operates Independently but Transparently
	•	While the SAB has a specialized oversight role, it does not control governance.
	•	Its decisions and reviews are expected to be transparent and accountable to the community.

⸻

🧾 4. Protect Protocol Integrity
	•	The SAB ensures that the governance system remains a force for protocol growth, not exploitation.
	•	Helps safeguard the long-term health of Trava’s DeFi + GameFi architecture.

⸻

📌 Summary Table

SAB Role	Description
🔍 Proposal Security Review	Screens governance proposals for risks
⛔ Veto Power	Can block or delay dangerous proposals
🧠 Independent Oversight	Acts as a neutral security gatekeeper

Would you like examples of what kinds of proposals might trigger SAB intervention, or how it compares to other DeFi protocol security councils?","The Security Advisory Board (SAB) in Trava Governance plays a critical oversight and protective role, acting as a guardian layer to ensure that governance proposals — especially those affecting protocol integrity — are secure, trustworthy, and not malicious.

⸻

🛡️ Role of the Security Advisory Board (SAB)

✅ 1. Proposal Vetting & Risk Review
	•	The SAB reviews high-impact governance proposals before they are executed.
	•	Focuses on proposals that involve:
	•	Smart contract upgrades
	•	Treasury fund movements
	•	Protocol-level changes
	•	Their role is to flag potential security risks, exploits, or flaws in logic.

⸻

✅ 2. Emergency Veto Power
	•	The SAB can intervene or delay proposal execution if a serious security threat is detected.
	•	This gives the protocol a “failsafe” mechanism to prevent harmful governance abuse, such as:
	•	Exploitable contract changes
	•	Unauthorized fund transfers
	•	Sybil governance attacks

⸻

✅ 3. Strategic Advisory
	•	SAB members may provide expert input on:
	•	Best security practices
	•	Safe deployment procedures
	•	Layered risk mitigation for newly proposed features

While not involved in day-to-day governance voting, they ensure proposals meet technical and security standards.

⸻

✅ 4. Maintaining Protocol Credibility
	•	Helps protect users from governance-related exploits
	•	Provides community confidence that the DAO operates responsibly and securely
	•	Acts similarly to a “guardian multisig” in other DeFi DAOs (e.g., Compound, Aave)

⸻

👥 Who Are the SAB Members?
	•	Typically experienced blockchain developers, auditors, or security researchers
	•	May be appointed by the Trava DAO or core team
	•	Their identities and roles may be public or semi-anonymous, depending on governance structure

These events could be an attempt to manipulate the market by centralized factors, the effort to attack the protocol, or other unexpected situations.\n \n**Why do we need a Security Advisory Board?**\nIn the world of blockchain, the biggest thing is users’ trust in a protocol based on their development potential and strong security.\nAlthough blockchain technology is secure, decentralized, and distributed, the risks still remain in many forms, especially in cryptocurrency. In fact, DeFi hacks are on the rise. Digital thieves had a big year in 2021, taking $3.2 billion in cryptocurrencies. This number is predicted to be even higher in 2022. In the first three months of this year, hackers have stolen $1.3 billion from exchanges, platforms, and private entities.\nFor that reason, we need to prepare for unexpected issues. As a long-term vision, Trava will soon implement the Trava Governance and go ahead with building an entire decentralized marketplace where the users are responsible for developing the protocol themselves.\nAt first, users with voting power will decide on critical terms of the Trava Lending Pool, such as adding or removing assets, changing the risk parameters, etc. In the long-term, these responsibilities are widened and affect the users-creation pools as well.\nDespite the advantages of a decentralized autonomous organization, especially in collecting the crowd’s wisdom before making a decision, this model brings the risks of being attacked or manipulated by a centralized entity, etc.\nTo be more specific, if most governance tokens are in the hand of centralized parties, it would be possible for a governance attack to occur where a centralized entity uses its users’ voting power to take over the governance proposals and voting.\nIn that case, it is necessary to have a group of people who can solve the problem quickly and effectively enough to prevent the worst scenario and consult reasonable strategies for avoiding the risks.\n \n**What are the primary roles of SAB?**\nAs mentioned, this group of people is responsible for the security of the Trava Governance, which is implied in some main points:\n * First, providing quick solutions for unexpected issues relating to the dramatic fluctuation of the market and hacking actions.\n * Second, recommending the strategy for improving the governance security.\n\n\n \n**Who are they?**\nGiven the crucial role of the SAB, in the beginning, this team combines experts who also take responsibility for the development of the Trava Ecosystem as a whole.\nWe would like to introduce the SAB team as below:\n * Mr. Minh Nguyen — CEO & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Duc Tran — Head of Security & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Thang Nguyen — CTO & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Quan Dinh — CPO & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Chung Dao — Strategy Advisor of Trava Finance- CEO & Co-founder Oraichain\n\n\nFirst, the security advisor board includes five people from the team, as mentioned above. However, in the future, the Trava governance will decide who is in this group, including both people from the Trava Team and community members.\nWith a strong and reliable group of experienced and professional people, we look forward to building Trava Governance to become a place where users can place their money and trust.\n— — — — — — — —"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-the-security-advisory-board-for-the-trava-governance-8bcf6799e90f?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----64-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.16666666666666666 }, { ""content"": ""Trava Governance module aims to bring the protocol to a new level of decentralization - Trava DAO.

,How does the governance process in Trava DAO work?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, the governance process in Trava DAO is a decentralized, community-driven system that allows TRAVA token holders (specifically those holding veTRAVA) to propose and vote on decisions that shape the protocol’s future.

⸻

🗳️ Governance Process in Trava DAO: Step-by-Step

✅ 1. Proposal Submission
	•	Any qualified user (usually with a minimum veTRAVA balance) can create a proposal.
	•	Proposals may cover:
	•	New pool launches
	•	Parameter changes (interest rates, LTV, fees)
	•	Emission and reward allocation
	•	Protocol upgrades or strategic decisions

⸻

✅ 2. Security Review by SAB
	•	Once submitted, proposals go through the Security Advisory Board (SAB).
	•	The SAB reviews proposals for:
	•	Code vulnerabilities
	•	Economic attack vectors
	•	Malicious content
	•	The SAB can veto or request changes if risks are identified.

⸻

✅ 3. Community Voting
	•	If approved by SAB, the proposal enters the voting phase.
	•	Voting is based on veTRAVA, which users earn by locking TRAVA tokens.
	•	Voting power depends on:
	•	Amount of TRAVA locked
	•	Duration of lock (longer = more veTRAVA)
	•	Users vote for or against the proposal during the set voting period (typically a few days).

⸻

✅ 4. Proposal Execution
	•	If the proposal meets the quorum and majority requirements, it is marked as approved.
	•	Depending on its nature:
	•	On-chain proposals are executed automatically via smart contracts.
	•	Off-chain or admin proposals may be executed by the Trava core team.

🗳️ Governance Process Overview in Trava DAO

✅ 1. Proposal Creation
	•	Any TRAVA token holder who meets the minimum token threshold can submit a governance proposal.
	•	Proposals may include:
	•	New lending pool parameters
	•	Protocol upgrades or contract changes
	•	TRAVA token emission adjustments
	•	Use of treasury or DAO funds
	•	Risk parameter modifications

💡 Requirements:
	•	Hold or stake a minimum amount of TRAVA tokens
	•	Submit proposal with:
	•	Clear title

	•	Implementation feasibility
	•	The SAB can delay or veto a proposal if it poses a critical threat.

⸻

✅ 3. Voting Period
	•	Once the proposal passes initial checks, it enters the voting phase.
	•	All eligible TRAVA holders can vote “For” or “Against”.
	•	Voting power is proportional to the number of staked TRAVA tokens.

⏱ Typical Settings:
	•	Voting duration: 3 to 7 days
	•	Quorum: Minimum number of total votes required for validity
	•	Snapshot: A snapshot of token balances is taken to prevent last-minute transfers

⸻

✅ 4. Vote Outcome

Result	Outcome
✅ Majority “Yes”	Proposal is approved and queued for execution
❌ Majority “No”	Proposal is rejected and not implemented
⚠️ No quorum	Proposal fails automatically due to insufficient votes


⸻

✅ 5. Execution
	•	If approved, the proposal is:
	•	Queued (sometimes with a time delay)
	•	Executed automatically via smart contract (on-chain governance)
	•	Or executed manually by the core team (for off-chain processes)

⸻

🧠 Example: Proposal Lifecycle

This blog post will explain why we need it, how it works and its mechanism._\nNFT Bridge is one of soon to be released features by Trava Finance\nNFTs are unique digital assets that are typically created and traded on a specific blockchain network, particularly in this case — Trava Knights. However, as NFT ecosystem expands, there is a need for interoperability between different blockchain networks to allow for seamless movement across platforms.\nIf you’ve been paying attention to our latest AMA, you might already know that Trava Finance is about to release many new features and one of which is the NFT Bridge. It will help solve this problem by enabling the transfer of Limited Knight NFTs from one blockchain to another, increasing the utility of the Knights, and opening new opportunities for creators, collectors, and users.\n \nWhy do we need the Trava NFT Bridge?\nKnight NFT is one of the outstanding unique products of Trava Finance, besides Trava Tickets, especially towards the goal of Decentralized Marketplace. Therefore, it will be a big regret if its operation and value are only encapsulated in our ecosystem as it is now.\nUsually, exchange across different blockchains without a bridge is possible, but it would be very expensive and time-consuming. That’s why Trava Finance decided to open NFT Bridge, which allows users to move their Knights between chains. By doing this, there are more chances for our products to participate in the wide-open market on the Ethereum network. This will also increase the utilization and value of Trava Knight NFTs.\nTrava NFT bridge still has some limitations, but we will definitely give it more uses in the future. For now, it can only support transfers to Ethereum and with Limited Knights:\n * Aleister — Eye of the Twelve.\n * Medivh — Ambassador of Techfian Principality.\n * Sir Kuana — Commander of TraDAO.\n * Dame Johanna — Shield of the Twelve.\n * Limited TR-A Valor-1.\n\n\n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains. The transition happens on the bridge seamlessly, you only need to pay a fee and follow some particular rules for it to work.\nWhen transferring, simply, your Limited Knight NFT(s) on the BSC mainnet will be locked, and the same one will be minted on Ethereum. When you want to transfer it back, the Limited Knight on Ethereum will be burned, and the locked version will be released. For more clarity on how it works, you can follow the detailed mechanism explanations below:\n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains. The transition happens on the bridge seamlessly, you only need to pay a fee and follow some particular rules for it to work.\nWhen transferring, simply, your Limited Knight NFT(s) on the BSC mainnet will be locked, and the same one will be minted on Ethereum. When you want to transfer it back, the Limited Knight on Ethereum will be burned, and the locked version will be released. For more clarity on how it works, you can follow the detailed mechanism explanations below:\n\nTransfer your Limited Knight NFT(s) from Source Chain to Destination Chain\nAfter starting this process, you will have to connect to the wallet that has the Knight NFT that you want to transfer, note that currently this bridge only supports Unique Collection. The transfer then goes through a verification process, which includes checking if the sender (you) is the owner of the NFT collection and has sent the required bridge fee.\nWhen those things are finished, your transfer will be processed and the bridge will lock your Limited Knight NFT, then retrieve all the necessary information about you and your assets. It then is encoded into a message, which will be sent by the MainBridge to a queue serving as a way to track transactions and handle any potential issues, such as missed events or system failures.\nUpon receiving the message, the Bridge checks its validity and emits an event containing the bridge data, which is then captured and verified by a Relayer. If the bridge data is deemed valid, the Relayer will sign the bridge data and send it back to you along with the signature, allowing the transfer process. Your Limited Knight NFT will be locked from this moment onward, and you won’t be able to access it from the Source Chain (BNB chain).\nThen, to get your NFT from the Destination Chain, you will have to prove it using the information received. It’s only usable once and remains valid for 2 months from the time of signing, and anyone can utilize it. However, the Limited Knight will be minted just for the person whose address has been specified. If everything is valid and the data has not been used before, the Bridge will mint the Limited Knight NFT for you (the intended receiver).\n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains. The transition happens on the bridge seamlessly, you only need to pay a fee and follow some particular rules for it to work.\nWhen transferring, simply, your Limited Knight NFT(s) on the BSC mainnet will be locked, and the same one will be minted on Ethereum. When you want to transfer it back, the Limited Knight on Ethereum will be burned, and the locked version will be released. For more clarity on how it works, you can follow the detailed mechanism explanations below:\n\nTransfer your Limited Knight NFT(s) from Destination Chain to Source Chain\nBasically, you will have to go through the similar process as above, only with some minor differences. The first is that after verifying specific criteria, instead of locking, the Limited Knight NFT on the Destination Chain will be burned. The process includes:\n * Verifying whether you are the rightful owner of the NFT collection.\n * Checking if it was originally bridged from the Source Chain.\n * Confirming the bridge fee is paid.\n\n\nOnce the Limited Knight NFT on Ethereum has been successfully burned, another message will be encoded just as mentioned in the previous section. You will go through a similar process, and then your Limited Knight NFt will be released from the locked state.\n**_About Trava.Finance_**\nTrava Finance is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending.\nWhile existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, Trava Finance offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.\nTrava Finance is deployed on the BSC and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks.\nWebsite | | | | Medium | | \n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains.

As in the Trava Lending pool, there are over 15 types of cryptocurrency on three chains, consisting of BSC, Fantom, and Ethereum.\nUsually, exchange across different blockchains for cryptocurrency is possible without a cross-chain bridge. However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to do so. That’s why we need a bridge that enables users to transit their tokens easier and faster at a low cost.\nFor now, Trava.finance has already opened a bridge that allows users to transfer their TRAVA tokens from Fantom to BSC and vice versa. However, given the increase of the rTRAVA utilities, we are pleased to introduce the rTRAVA bridge that helps our users to exchange rTRAVA tokens from Fantom and Ethereum to BSC.\n \n**What benefit does the rTRAVA bridge bring to the whole ecosystem?**\nAs mentioned, users can transit rTRAVA tokens from Fantom and Ethereum to BSC easier and cheaper with the rTRAVA bridge.\nBy doing that, there are more chances for them to participate in various programs on the BSC network, especially in locking their tokens in the Trava governance vault to attain voting power and rewards.\nTo be more specific, in Trava Governance, the decision-making power of users corresponds with the volume of TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB they lock in the Trava Governance vault.\nAt first, the voting power attained from locking TRAVA and rTRAVA is the same. However, there will be some differences between these two that locking rTRAVA will get more significant power in the future. Thus, locking rTRAVA seems to be a smart choice to improve the influence in the ecosystem quickly.\nNevertheless, the Trava Governance vault is implemented on the BSC platform that stops users from locking rTRAVA tokens.\nBy implementing the rTRAVA bridge, users now can effortlessly transfer rTRAVA from Ethereum and Fantom to BSC, lock them then attain both rewards and decision-making power.\nThe rTRAVA Bridge\n \n**How does it work?**\nAs mentioned, the rTRAVA bridge makes the token transition process quicker and effortless. When transit your rTRAVA tokens through the bridge, you only need to pay a small amount of bridge fee and follow some particular rules.\nTwo options relating to the parameters of the rTRAVA bridge are shown in the table below. Thus, a voting snapshot will soon be opened for our community to choose which one should be officially applied.\n 1. _Delay time_**:** The period you need to wait for implementing the transaction.\n 2. _Bridge Fee_ : The fee (in TRAVA) you need to pay for each transaction using the rTRAVA bridge.\n\n\n**_Examples for calculating the bridge fee:_**"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-the-rtrava-bridge-678b349767ae?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----62-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""**How to participate in Governance?**\nTrava users need to lock their Trava/rTrava for veTRAVA token to participate in the on-chain governance process.

🗳️ How to Gain Governance Power in Trava DAO

✅ 1. Lock TRAVA Tokens to Get veTRAVA
	•	veTRAVA is the token used for governance voting.
	•	To obtain veTRAVA, users must lock TRAVA tokens for a fixed period (up to 4 years).
	•	The amount of veTRAVA received is based on:
	•	The amount of TRAVA locked
	•	The duration of the lock
	•	Longer lock = more veTRAVA

Example:
Locking 1,000 TRAVA for 4 years gives you 1,000 veTRAVA.
Locking the same amount for 1 year gives less veTRAVA (e.g., ~250).

⸻

🔁 2. Maintain or Increase veTRAVA
	•	veTRAVA decays linearly over time as the lock approaches its end.
	•	To maintain or grow voting power, you can:
	•	Extend the lock duration
	•	Add more TRAVA to the existing lock
	•	Re-lock after expiration

⸻

📍 3. Use veTRAVA in Governance

Once you hold veTRAVA, you can:
	•	Vote on proposals
	•	Submit proposals (if you meet the minimum threshold)
	•	Influence key decisions like:
	•	Lending pool configurations
	•	Emission schedules
	•	Strategic changes in the protocol

⸻

📌 Summary Table

Action	Result
Lock TRAVA for 1–4 years	Gain veTRAVA
More TRAVA / longer time	More veTRAVA
veTRAVA decays over time	Governance power reduces unless re-locked
Use veTRAVA	Vote and propose changes in Trava DAO

This blog post will explain why we need it, how it works and its mechanism._\nNFT Bridge is one of soon to be released features by Trava Finance\nNFTs are unique digital assets that are typically created and traded on a specific blockchain network, particularly in this case — Trava Knights. However, as NFT ecosystem expands, there is a need for interoperability between different blockchain networks to allow for seamless movement across platforms.\nIf you’ve been paying attention to our latest AMA, you might already know that Trava Finance is about to release many new features and one of which is the NFT Bridge. It will help solve this problem by enabling the transfer of Limited Knight NFTs from one blockchain to another, increasing the utility of the Knights, and opening new opportunities for creators, collectors, and users.\n \nWhy do we need the Trava NFT Bridge?\nKnight NFT is one of the outstanding unique products of Trava Finance, besides Trava Tickets, especially towards the goal of Decentralized Marketplace. Therefore, it will be a big regret if its operation and value are only encapsulated in our ecosystem as it is now.\nUsually, exchange across different blockchains without a bridge is possible, but it would be very expensive and time-consuming. That’s why Trava Finance decided to open NFT Bridge, which allows users to move their Knights between chains. By doing this, there are more chances for our products to participate in the wide-open market on the Ethereum network. This will also increase the utilization and value of Trava Knight NFTs.\nTrava NFT bridge still has some limitations, but we will definitely give it more uses in the future. For now, it can only support transfers to Ethereum and with Limited Knights:\n * Aleister — Eye of the Twelve.\n * Medivh — Ambassador of Techfian Principality.\n * Sir Kuana — Commander of TraDAO.\n * Dame Johanna — Shield of the Twelve.\n * Limited TR-A Valor-1.\n\n\n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains. The transition happens on the bridge seamlessly, you only need to pay a fee and follow some particular rules for it to work.\nWhen transferring, simply, your Limited Knight NFT(s) on the BSC mainnet will be locked, and the same one will be minted on Ethereum. When you want to transfer it back, the Limited Knight on Ethereum will be burned, and the locked version will be released. For more clarity on how it works, you can follow the detailed mechanism explanations below:\n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains. The transition happens on the bridge seamlessly, you only need to pay a fee and follow some particular rules for it to work.\nWhen transferring, simply, your Limited Knight NFT(s) on the BSC mainnet will be locked, and the same one will be minted on Ethereum. When you want to transfer it back, the Limited Knight on Ethereum will be burned, and the locked version will be released. For more clarity on how it works, you can follow the detailed mechanism explanations below:\n\nTransfer your Limited Knight NFT(s) from Source Chain to Destination Chain\nAfter starting this process, you will have to connect to the wallet that has the Knight NFT that you want to transfer, note that currently this bridge only supports Unique Collection. The transfer then goes through a verification process, which includes checking if the sender (you) is the owner of the NFT collection and has sent the required bridge fee.\nWhen those things are finished, your transfer will be processed and the bridge will lock your Limited Knight NFT, then retrieve all the necessary information about you and your assets. It then is encoded into a message, which will be sent by the MainBridge to a queue serving as a way to track transactions and handle any potential issues, such as missed events or system failures.\nUpon receiving the message, the Bridge checks its validity and emits an event containing the bridge data, which is then captured and verified by a Relayer. If the bridge data is deemed valid, the Relayer will sign the bridge data and send it back to you along with the signature, allowing the transfer process. Your Limited Knight NFT will be locked from this moment onward, and you won’t be able to access it from the Source Chain (BNB chain).\nThen, to get your NFT from the Destination Chain, you will have to prove it using the information received. It’s only usable once and remains valid for 2 months from the time of signing, and anyone can utilize it. However, the Limited Knight will be minted just for the person whose address has been specified. If everything is valid and the data has not been used before, the Bridge will mint the Limited Knight NFT for you (the intended receiver).\n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains. The transition happens on the bridge seamlessly, you only need to pay a fee and follow some particular rules for it to work.\nWhen transferring, simply, your Limited Knight NFT(s) on the BSC mainnet will be locked, and the same one will be minted on Ethereum. When you want to transfer it back, the Limited Knight on Ethereum will be burned, and the locked version will be released. For more clarity on how it works, you can follow the detailed mechanism explanations below:\n\nTransfer your Limited Knight NFT(s) from Destination Chain to Source Chain\nBasically, you will have to go through the similar process as above, only with some minor differences. The first is that after verifying specific criteria, instead of locking, the Limited Knight NFT on the Destination Chain will be burned. The process includes:\n * Verifying whether you are the rightful owner of the NFT collection.\n * Checking if it was originally bridged from the Source Chain.\n * Confirming the bridge fee is paid.\n\n\nOnce the Limited Knight NFT on Ethereum has been successfully burned, another message will be encoded just as mentioned in the previous section. You will go through a similar process, and then your Limited Knight NFt will be released from the locked state.\n**_About Trava.Finance_**\nTrava Finance is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending.\nWhile existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, Trava Finance offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.\nTrava Finance is deployed on the BSC and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks.\nWebsite | | | | Medium | | \n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains.

As in the Trava Lending pool, there are over 15 types of cryptocurrency on three chains, consisting of BSC, Fantom, and Ethereum.\nUsually, exchange across different blockchains for cryptocurrency is possible without a cross-chain bridge. However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to do so. That’s why we need a bridge that enables users to transit their tokens easier and faster at a low cost.\nFor now, Trava.finance has already opened a bridge that allows users to transfer their TRAVA tokens from Fantom to BSC and vice versa. However, given the increase of the rTRAVA utilities, we are pleased to introduce the rTRAVA bridge that helps our users to exchange rTRAVA tokens from Fantom and Ethereum to BSC.\n \n**What benefit does the rTRAVA bridge bring to the whole ecosystem?**\nAs mentioned, users can transit rTRAVA tokens from Fantom and Ethereum to BSC easier and cheaper with the rTRAVA bridge.\nBy doing that, there are more chances for them to participate in various programs on the BSC network, especially in locking their tokens in the Trava governance vault to attain voting power and rewards.\nTo be more specific, in Trava Governance, the decision-making power of users corresponds with the volume of TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB they lock in the Trava Governance vault.\nAt first, the voting power attained from locking TRAVA and rTRAVA is the same. However, there will be some differences between these two that locking rTRAVA will get more significant power in the future. Thus, locking rTRAVA seems to be a smart choice to improve the influence in the ecosystem quickly.\nNevertheless, the Trava Governance vault is implemented on the BSC platform that stops users from locking rTRAVA tokens.\nBy implementing the rTRAVA bridge, users now can effortlessly transfer rTRAVA from Ethereum and Fantom to BSC, lock them then attain both rewards and decision-making power.\nThe rTRAVA Bridge\n \n**How does it work?**\nAs mentioned, the rTRAVA bridge makes the token transition process quicker and effortless. When transit your rTRAVA tokens through the bridge, you only need to pay a small amount of bridge fee and follow some particular rules.\nTwo options relating to the parameters of the rTRAVA bridge are shown in the table below. Thus, a voting snapshot will soon be opened for our community to choose which one should be officially applied.\n 1. _Delay time_**:** The period you need to wait for implementing the transaction.\n 2. _Bridge Fee_ : The fee (in TRAVA) you need to pay for each transaction using the rTRAVA bridge.\n\n\n**_Examples for calculating the bridge fee:_**"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-the-rtrava-bridge-678b349767ae?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----62-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""**How to participate in Governance?**\nTrava users need to lock their Trava/rTrava for veTRAVA token to participate in the on-chain governance process.

🧮 How veTRAVA Works

Input	Impact on veTRAVA
Amount of TRAVA	More TRAVA → more veTRAVA
Lock Duration	Longer lock (up to 4 years) → more veTRAVA
Time Decay	veTRAVA decays linearly as time passes

For example:
Locking 1,000 TRAVA for 4 years = 1,000 veTRAVA
Locking 1,000 TRAVA for 1 year = ~250 veTRAVA
Locking 500 TRAVA for 2 years = ~250 veTRAVA

In this case, veTRAVA, in the form of NFT, represents this power and is determined by the time and amount of locked tokens (as they show your commitment toward the future of Trava Finance).\nWith the implementation of the Trava Governance Vault, users can lock their TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB into this vault to receive a certain amount of veTRAVA representing their powers: the more veTRAVA you own, the higher your voting power in the Trava ecosystem. ## The Benefits Of Owning veTRAVA\nThe key value of veTRAVA is its representative of users’ power and their commitment to the project. As a result, in the long term, users who own veTRAVA can receive significant benefits:\n * Deciding on crucial parameters such as LTV, risk parameters, etc., in the lending pools (Trava Lending Pool and Users-owned Pools).\n * Receiving share profit coming from the fee charged by borrowers\n * Receiving boosting rewards **in rTRAVA** by providing liquidity and holding veTRAVA at the same time.\n * Earning TRAVA reward: the APR will be revealed soon.\n\n\nAs mentioned, veTRAVA is utilized as a form of NFT. For now, it can only be available for those who lock their token into the Governance Vault. However, it will be exchanged peer-to-peer with the launch of veTRAVA Marketplace. # veTRAVA Marketplace: Overview\nAs its name suggests, the veTRAVA marketplace is for users to buy and sell their veTRAVA. It means they can freely exchange their voting power. The main reason we came up with this idea is to optimize users’ experience, bringing them as much freedom as possible. It’s the “Decentralization” we are heading for.\nBesides bringing more freedom to users, veTRAVA Marketplace increases liquidity for veTRAVA and thus benefits both sellers and buyers. In more detail, buyers can buy veTRAVA (voting power) easily on Marketplace and then earn voting power immediately. In this case, the remaining locking time will be more flexible, no longer limited to a particular period set in the Governance Vault. When it comes to sellers, they can easily utilize crypto assets in a more liberal way and get benefits from it. ## The Influences of veTRAVA Marketplace\nveTRAVA Marketplace is an important feature that contributes to the development of Trava Governance. As mentioned above, users who hold many veTRAVA will have a crucial role in the decision-making process of the Trava Finance ecosystem. The veTRAVA holders can alternate the voting results, and through the Marketplace, users can buy or sell the voting power with others.\nWith the fact that users can trade their voting power to each other, anyone in the ecosystem will have a chance to vote for the changes they want to make in Trava Finance. The more users have veTRAVA, the more voting power is distributed, and users will be given the full power to make the decisions that can affect the Decentralized Lending Marketplace, which will elevate the decentralized side of Trava Finance’s ultimate goal."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-vetrava-marketplace-c9092a0c51c8"", ""rrf_score"": 0.08333333333333333 }, { ""content"": ""## Introduction Alpha Version of Trava Token Health\n ### What is Token Health?\nAug 26, 2021\nAug 26, 2021"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/?source=post_page---byline--63d315146b69---------------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""##\n**Introduction to Vote Locking mechanism**\nTrava & rTrava holders can vote-lock their tokens into the Trava Governance to receive veTRAVA, which holds voting power.

	•	Boosting rewards is typically:
	•	Proportional to veTRAVA amount
	•	Subject to boosting limits or caps
	•	Creates an incentive to lock TRAVA longer for better APY multipliers

⸻

🧪 3. Vote for Reward Allocation (Gauge Voting)
	•	Trava may implement “gauge-style” voting, where veTRAVA holders vote to allocate TRAVA emissions to specific pools.
	•	Example: Vote to direct more rewards to your preferred lending pool or NFT staking pool.
	•	This mechanism:
	•	Increases pool competition
	•	Gives veTRAVA holders direct influence over ecosystem incentives

,Why do we need veTRAVA?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, veTRAVA (vote-escrowed TRAVA) is essential because it ensures that governance power is held by long-term, committed stakeholders, not short-term speculators. It aligns incentives and gives the most influence to those who have the strongest interest in the protocol’s long-term success.

⸻

🎯 Why Do We Need veTRAVA in Trava Finance?

🗳️ 1. Enables Decentralized Governance
	•	veTRAVA is the exclusive governance token in Trava DAO.
	•	It allows the community—not the core team—to:
	•	Vote on protocol upgrades
	•	Guide emissions and reward allocation
	•	Approve new lending pools or strategies

✅ Without veTRAVA, governance would be either centralized or vulnerable to short-term manipulation.

⸻

⛓️ 2. Locks in Long-Term Commitment
	•	Users must lock TRAVA tokens for up to 4 years to earn veTRAVA.
	•	This:
	•	Aligns governance with long-term thinkers
	•	Discourages “vote farming” and flash-loan attacks
	•	Creates a deflationary pressure by reducing circulating TRAVA

⸻

📉 3. Protects Against Dilution
	•	As new TRAVA tokens are minted or distributed, older holders risk losing influence.
	•	veTRAVA preserves voting power for those who lock tokens early and long.
	•	This maintains a fair power structure over time.

⸻

💡 4. Enables Weighted and Fair Voting
	•	Voting is not 1 token = 1 vote.
	•	Instead, it’s 1 veTRAVA = 1 vote, and veTRAVA depends on:
	•	Amount of TRAVA locked
	•	Duration of lock
	•	This ensures more nuanced, influence-weighted governance.

⸻

💰 5. Incentivizes Positive Participation
	•	veTRAVA holders may:
	•	Earn boosted rewards
	•	Gain access to exclusive staking benefits
	•	Vote on where emissions (TRAVA distribution) go

This creates a positive feedback loop where good actors are rewarded.

⸻

📌 Summary Table: Why veTRAVA Is Needed

Purpose	Benefit
🗳️ DAO Governance	Powers voting and proposal system
🔐 Long-term Alignment	Locks capital to ensure loyal participants
🛡️ Anti-Dilution Mechanism	Maintains governance power against inflation
💵 Reward Allocation	Directs where incentives and yields go
🚫 Flash-attack Resistance	Prevents governance manipulation


⸻

Would you like a side-by-side comparison of veTRAVA vs TRAVA or an interactive calculator for lock duration and voting power?","We need veTRAVA (vote-escrowed TRAVA) in the Trava Finance ecosystem to create a more secure, decentralized, and incentive-aligned governance model that rewards long-term commitment, discourages short-term manipulation, and gives users real control over protocol development.

Here’s why veTRAVA is essential:

⸻

🔐 1. Aligns Governance with Long-Term Stakeholders
	•	Only users who lock their TRAVA over time receive veTRAVA, meaning:
	•	Short-term speculators have less influence
	•	Committed users shape the future of the protocol
	•	This prevents flash-loan governance attacks or vote-buying schemes

📌 The longer and more you lock, the more governance power you get.

⸻

🗳️ 2. Enables Fair and Decentralized Voting
	•	veTRAVA makes governance more secure and representative:
	•	Proposals can only pass with support from users who have real “skin in the game”
	•	Voting weight is based on commitment, not just token amount

⸻

📈 3. Incentivizes Protocol Loyalty
	•	By offering boosted rewards for users with veTRAVA, the protocol:
	•	Encourages users to lock TRAVA tokens
	•	Increases token scarcity (less circulating supply)
	•	Builds a strong community of long-term participants

🔁 This creates a feedback loop: lock TRAVA → earn veTRAVA → boost rewards → gain more TRAVA.

⸻

🎯 4. Powers Emission Control & Pool Incentives
	•	With veTRAVA, users can vote on where TRAVA emissions go (via “gauge voting”):
	•	Direct more rewards to the pools they support
	•	Balance incentives across lending, staking, and NFT utility

This creates a dynamic, community-driven economy within Trava.

⸻

🧱 5. Adds Structure to DAO Governance
	•	veTRAVA enables a clear framework for:
	•	Proposal creation and thresholds
	•	Voting rights and quorum validation
	•	Role-based privileges in Trava DAO

⸻

🧠 Summary: Why We Need veTRAVA

Reason	Benefit
🗳️ Fair voting	Gives voice to long-term aligned token holders
🔐 Security	Prevents abuse from flash-loans or short-term whales
📈 Loyalty rewards	Boosts yield for committed users
⚙️ Emission control	Lets community vote where TRAVA incentives are directed
🧱 Governance structure	Provides scalable, trustless DAO decision-making

,What is voting power?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, voting power in the Trava DAO refers to the influence a user holds when participating in governance decisions, and it is determined by how much veTRAVA (vote-escrowed TRAVA) the user owns.

⸻

🗳️ What Is Voting Power in Trava DAO?

Voting power = the amount of veTRAVA a user has
This voting power is used to:
	•	Vote for or against governance proposals
	•	Influence reward distributions, new pool launches, protocol upgrades, and more
	•	Potentially create proposals (if the power exceeds a required threshold)

⸻

📐 How Is Voting Power Calculated?

Your voting power depends on:

Factor	Effect on Voting Power
🔒 TRAVA amount locked	More TRAVA → more veTRAVA (and thus more voting power)
⏳ Lock duration	Longer lock = more veTRAVA (up to 4 years)
📉 Time decay	veTRAVA (and voting power) decreases linearly as the lock period elapses

Example:
Locking 1,000 TRAVA for 4 years = 1,000 veTRAVA → 1,000 voting power
Locking 1,000 TRAVA for 1 year ≈ 250 veTRAVA → 250 voting power

⸻

🧾 Why Voting Power Matters

Use Case	Role of Voting Power
✅ Governance Voting	Determines your weight in passing or rejecting proposals
🧠 Proposal Creation	Requires minimum voting power to initiate a proposal
📊 Incentive Control	Helps allocate TRAVA emissions or pool rewards
🛡️ Decentralized Decisions	Ensures control remains with long-term, committed users


⸻

🧠 Summary

Term	Description
veTRAVA	Non-transferable governance token
Voting Power	Equal to your veTRAVA balance
Earned by	Locking TRAVA for up to 4 years
Used for	Voting, proposing, influencing Trava DAO


⸻

Would you like a calculator or visual tool to estimate your voting power based on your TRAVA and lock time?","In Trava Finance, voting power refers to the amount of influence you have when participating in governance decisions within the Trava DAO. Your voting power determines how much weight your vote carries when supporting or rejecting proposals.

🗳️ What Is Voting Power in Trava?

Concept	Explanation
Voting Power	The strength of your vote in Trava DAO governance
Based On	The amount of veTRAVA you hold (not just TRAVA)
Used For	Voting on proposals, emissions, and other DAO decisions


⸻

🔁 How Is Voting Power Calculated?

You receive voting power by locking TRAVA tokens to get veTRAVA.
	•	The more TRAVA you lock and the longer you lock it, the more veTRAVA (and thus voting power) you get.

🧮 Formula (Simplified):

veTRAVA = TRAVA amount × (Lock duration / Max lock duration)

	•	Max lock duration is usually 4 years
	•	Example:
Lock 10,000 TRAVA for 2 years → ~5,000 veTRAVA = 5,000 voting power

⸻

📌 What Can You Do with Voting Power?

Use Case	How Voting Power Is Used
✅ Vote on DAO proposals	Support or reject protocol changes
🎯 Vote on reward allocations	Decide which pools receive TRAVA incentives
🧱 Proposal creation (threshold)	Required to submit new proposals
🧠 Influence governance	Help steer the Trava ecosystem’s evolution


⸻

🧠 Why Voting Power Matters
	•	Decentralization: Shifts power from core devs to the community
	•	Security: Blocks bad proposals or malicious actors
	•	Rewards: Can affect which staking pools or NFTs get boosted returns

,How do veTRAVA holders earn rewards?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, veTRAVA holders earn rewards as an incentive for their long-term commitment and active participation in governance. Rewards are distributed through mechanisms like Dilution Staking, voting incentives, and possibly protocol revenue sharing.

⸻

💰 How veTRAVA Holders Earn Rewards

🧱 1. Dilution Staking
	•	By locking TRAVA tokens, users receive veTRAVA and become eligible for Dilution Staking rewards.
	•	Rewards are distributed based on the amount and duration of locked TRAVA.
	•	Purpose: encourage long-term locking and protect users from TRAVA token dilution.

🔁 Longer lock = more veTRAVA = larger share of rewards

⸻

🗳️ 2. Voting Incentives
	•	Trava DAO may distribute incentives to veTRAVA holders who actively participate in governance votes.
	•	This encourages engagement and decentralization.
	•	Users with higher veTRAVA get more voting weight and potentially larger rewards.

⸻

🏦 3. Protocol Revenue Sharing (Optional/Planned)
	•	Trava may share a portion of protocol fees or treasury yield with veTRAVA holders.
	•	The design aligns with other veToken models (e.g. veCRV in Curve), rewarding loyal participants with protocol income.

⸻

📊 Reward Calculation Factors

Factor	Impact
🔒 Amount of TRAVA locked	More locked = more veTRAVA = more rewards
⏳ Lock duration	Longer lock = higher veTRAVA
📉 veTRAVA decay	As veTRAVA decays, rewards decrease unless extended
📈 Protocol activity	More usage = more rewards to distribute


⸻

📌 Summary Table

Reward Source	Description
🧱 Dilution Staking	Earn TRAVA for committing to long-term locks
🗳️ Voting Participation	Get incentives for engaging in governance
💰 Revenue Sharing	(If enabled) Share in fees or earnings from protocol use

The longer they lock, the more voting power they possess. Vote locking allows you to vote in governance and receive rewards from special incentive programs.\n \n\n**What is veTRAVA?**\nveTRAVA stands for voting escrow Trava. It is an ERC721 token that acts as evidence of your locking token in the governance module. Every time users create a new lock, they receive a veTRAVA token, storing their locked balance, unlock time, and rewards amount.\nThe longer you lock your tokens, the more voting power you have (and the bigger incentive you can earn). For example, you can vote lock 1,000 TRAVA/rTRAVA for a year to have 250 voting power. Each token locked for four years is equal to 1 voting power.\nThe number of voting power you will receive depends on your locked balance & unlock time. \nThe minimum locking time is one week, and the maximum locking time is four years.\nYour voting power gradually decreases as your escrow tokens approach their lock expiry.

,What is the purpose of the adaptive rewarding mechanism?,"According to the Trava Finance documentation, the purpose of the Adaptive Rewarding Mechanism is to ensure that TRAVA token incentives are distributed fairly and sustainably — based on actual user contribution, time commitment, and governance participation.

⸻

🎯 Purpose of the Adaptive Rewarding Mechanism

1. 🧠 Promote Long-Term Commitment
	•	Encourages users to lock TRAVA for longer periods to earn more rewards.
	•	This builds a more loyal and aligned user base, reducing short-term speculation.

🔒 Longer lock = more veTRAVA = higher rewards

⸻

2. 📉 Combat Token Dilution
	•	Prevents long-term users from being diluted by short-term stakers.
	•	veTRAVA decays over time, so only those maintaining or extending locks retain high reward eligibility.

⸻

3. ⚖️ Ensure Fair Reward Distribution
	•	Rewards are proportional to user commitment:
	•	Amount of TRAVA locked
	•	Duration of the lock
	•	Active participation in governance (via veTRAVA)

Users with more veTRAVA (vote-escrowed TRAVA) get a larger share of emissions or incentives.

⸻

4. 🔁 Align Rewards with Governance Activity
	•	veTRAVA holders who actively vote or participate in Trava DAO decisions can receive voting incentives.
	•	This strengthens decentralized governance and discourages passive holding.

⸻

5. 🛡️ Strengthen Protocol Sustainability
	•	Avoids excessive or blind emissions that could harm token value.
	•	Allows reward emission to dynamically adjust to ecosystem behavior and governance decisions.

⸻

📌 Summary Table: Adaptive Rewarding Mechanism

Goal	Description
🧠 Long-term alignment	Encourages users to lock TRAVA and hold veTRAVA
📊 Fair distribution	Rewards based on actual contribution and time
🛡️ Anti-dilution	Protects committed users from inflation
🗳️ Governance incentive	Encourages voting and DAO activity
⚙️ Sustainability	Keeps TRAVA emissions adaptive and controlled


⸻

Would you like a visual breakdown of how rewards scale with veTRAVA, or a simulation of different lock scenarios and their rewards?","The adaptive rewarding mechanism in Trava Finance is designed to dynamically distribute rewards based on user behavior, contribution levels, and commitment to the protocol. Its main purpose is to incentivize long-term, meaningful participation in a fair and efficient way, while protecting the ecosystem from exploitation.

⸻

🎯 Purpose of the Adaptive Rewarding Mechanism

✅ 1. Reward Long-Term Commitment
	•	Users who lock TRAVA longer (via veTRAVA) receive greater rewards.
	•	This discourages short-term speculation and promotes ecosystem stability.

Example: Locking TRAVA for 1 year earns fewer rewards than locking for 4 years.

⸻

✅ 2. Encourage Active Participation
	•	Rewards are distributed based on activity and engagement, such as:
	•	Voting in governance
	•	Providing liquidity
	•	Staking NFTs or TRAVA
	•	More active users receive a larger share of emissions.

⸻

✅ 3. Protect Against Exploits
	•	The system reduces rewards for users who:
	•	Frequently lock/unlock to game the system
	•	Try to farm rewards without long-term commitment
	•	This helps maintain a healthy distribution and deters bad actors.

⸻

✅ 4. Optimize TRAVA Emissions
	•	Adaptive rewards adjust based on:
	•	Current protocol health
	•	Pool usage and demand
	•	Governance voting outcomes
	•	This ensures that TRAVA emissions are not wasted, and are directed to where they’re most beneficial (via gauge voting).

⸻

✅ 5. Gamify User Engagement
	•	Users may earn more rewards by:
	•	Leveling up NFTs
	•	Transmuting items
	•	Holding specific governance roles
	•	This gamification layer enhances user experience and deepens ecosystem involvement.

⸻

📌 Summary Table

Goal	How Adaptive Rewards Help
🕒 Encourage long-term locking	More veTRAVA = more rewards
🗳️ Boost governance participation	Active voters get bonuses
🔐 Defend against manipulation	Prevents short-term farming and dumping
📈 Optimize TRAVA emissions	Adjusts flows to pools with real usage/demand
🎮 Incentivize ecosystem actions	Rewards NFT use, staking, loyalty-based events

As in the Trava Lending pool, there are over 15 types of cryptocurrency on three chains, consisting of BSC, Fantom, and Ethereum.\nUsually, exchange across different blockchains for cryptocurrency is possible without a cross-chain bridge. However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to do so. That’s why we need a bridge that enables users to transit their tokens easier and faster at a low cost.\nFor now, Trava.finance has already opened a bridge that allows users to transfer their TRAVA tokens from Fantom to BSC and vice versa. However, given the increase of the rTRAVA utilities, we are pleased to introduce the rTRAVA bridge that helps our users to exchange rTRAVA tokens from Fantom and Ethereum to BSC.\n \n**What benefit does the rTRAVA bridge bring to the whole ecosystem?**\nAs mentioned, users can transit rTRAVA tokens from Fantom and Ethereum to BSC easier and cheaper with the rTRAVA bridge.\nBy doing that, there are more chances for them to participate in various programs on the BSC network, especially in locking their tokens in the Trava governance vault to attain voting power and rewards.\nTo be more specific, in Trava Governance, the decision-making power of users corresponds with the volume of TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB they lock in the Trava Governance vault.\nAt first, the voting power attained from locking TRAVA and rTRAVA is the same. However, there will be some differences between these two that locking rTRAVA will get more significant power in the future. Thus, locking rTRAVA seems to be a smart choice to improve the influence in the ecosystem quickly.\nNevertheless, the Trava Governance vault is implemented on the BSC platform that stops users from locking rTRAVA tokens.\nBy implementing the rTRAVA bridge, users now can effortlessly transfer rTRAVA from Ethereum and Fantom to BSC, lock them then attain both rewards and decision-making power.\nThe rTRAVA Bridge\n \n**How does it work?**\nAs mentioned, the rTRAVA bridge makes the token transition process quicker and effortless. When transit your rTRAVA tokens through the bridge, you only need to pay a small amount of bridge fee and follow some particular rules.\nTwo options relating to the parameters of the rTRAVA bridge are shown in the table below. Thus, a voting snapshot will soon be opened for our community to choose which one should be officially applied.\n  1. _Delay time_**:** The period you need to wait for implementing the transaction.\n  2. _Bridge Fee_ : The fee (in TRAVA) you need to pay for each transaction using the rTRAVA bridge.\n\n\n**_Examples for calculating the bridge fee:_**"",

With the presence of Dr. Minh, CEO of Trava Finance, Mr. Thang, CTO of Trava Finance, Ms. Quinn, Marketing Lead of Trava Finance and Ms. Michelle — BD of TechFi, this meetup is a major element of the introduction of Trava’s new phase and a new connection with TechFi, an educational website about crypto and blockchain for investors and developers. The meetup is going to reveal a potential connection in the future between the 2 projects.\nThe meet-up was divided into 3 parts: (1) Greeting and Introduction, (2) In-depth Discussion, and (3) Ending.\nIn this Recap, we will try to summarize the most interesting points for you.\n \n**Part 1: Greeting and Introduction**\n**Ms. Quinn**\nGood afternoon ladies and gentlemen. My name is Quinn, Marketing Lead at TRAVA.finance. It’s my pleasure to welcome you here today.\nGuys, I am very very excited right now. As all of u know even though there are already 3 meetup episodes, this is the 1st time we have a livestream ever in our community\nJoining us today, I’m glad to introduce Dr. Minh and Mr. Thang, our CEO and CTO who are co-founders of Trava Finance. They will walk us through some main points as short-term goals of Trava and the next actions in terms of technology, marketing, and business development plan in this bearish market situation. I’m also super excited because today we got here a secret guest who will be speaking at the last part of the meetup.\nThere are totally three parts today: Give a brief view at first, then go to detailed information on the Development Plan of Trava Finance. And the last one — I bet u guys will be curious about the guest and listen to sharings about marketing development.\nHi Minh. Hi Thang. How are you doing?\n**Dr. Minh**\nHi Quinn, I’m doing great. Really nice to be here with our community and have a close conversation with you guys, especially in the situation that we’re going through all the uncertainties and insecurities appearing recently in the world of cryptocurrency.\n**Mr. Thang**\nHi, Quinn. Hi everybody. I’m good, I hope you’re doing well. To be honest, I’ve been a bit busy lately, have been researching and digging deep into the market lately. So it’s really great to sit together and talk with you guys and then walk you through all of the plans we are heading towards. And excited to talk to our guests at the same time.\n**Ms. Quinn**\nGreat! Seems that we are all ready for the discussion with our Knights today.\n \n**Part 2: In-depth Discussion**\n \n**Part 2: In-depth Discussion**\n\nTopic1: Development plan overview in Tech and Marketing\n**Ms. Quinn**\nSo, as you know, the market situation seems to be rather red and not good for many projects and investors as well. Many investors are panicked since they can not handle the situation, and some start to sell, creating great selling pressure. As the CEO, Minh, can u share to our Knights your strategies to maintain the growth of the project and keep the trust among the community?\n**Dr. Minh**\nIt’s really hard to say what is right to do at that time in this bear market. So I have been listening to the feedback from our community, observing the market, and consulting a lot of individuals who are experienced in cryptocurrency.\nIn fact, we still try to stick with the initial ideas that follow our long-term vision. At the same time, we also have some modifications to adapt to the bear market at the moment, including some new ideas about technology, marketing, and business.\n \n**Part 2: In-depth Discussion**\n\nTopic 2: Technology development plan\n**Ms. Quinn**\nGreat! Talk about the technology development, could you please give users some detailed information\n**Dr. Minh**\nActually, we are trying to stick with our long-term vision, but at the same time having some modifications to adapt to the current market.\nMore specifically, as you know, in the long run, Trava will be the first protocol allowing users to create their own lending pool and build a total decentralized marketplace. We still try to stick with this idea and gradually provide users with unique features related to NFT-collateralization, cross-chain, and data analysis. Et cetera.\nAt the same time, we also have some modifications to handle the bear market at the moment. We will focus on some main products that actually meet the user’s needs and prioritize creating a thorough information workflow that ensures the community has the needed information. I believe it is an effective way to build trust and engagement in the ecosystem.\nFor detailed information, I suppose we should listen to Thang.\n**Mr. Thang**\nAbsolutely right, Dr. Minh. It’s better to focus on something that actually works and benefits our users, both old and new ones.\nActually, allowing users to create their own lending pool is our long-term vision. We saw its potential and benefit at first and still believe in its critical role in the ecosystem. In addition, in the future, we also seek to build a decentralized marketplace that users have fully responsible for.\nIt’s a long way to go. Actually, we are gradually reaching this goal by generating the Trava Governance. You know, a forum and then a locked vault was released, and the Trava Governance will be officially live on 19th May, prepare for it, guys. Moreover, on the way to reaching these goals, we bring users benefits with our unique products. They are about the cross-chain transition, NFT collateralization, and data analysis.\nOne more thing, I bet most people know that the Trava Ecosystem now includes Trava NFT, TraDAO, and Trava lending pool. The three of them have a close relationship, and all together, they enrich our ecosystem day by day.\n**Ms. Quinn**\nThat’s a strong relationship between Lending Pool and NFT. So what’s about Lending Pool and TraDAO. Is it a closed relationship?\nTrava Ecosystem\n**Mr. Thang**\nTalking about the connection between the Lending pool and TraDAO, we have already calculated the reputation of users in the whole Trava ecosystem, starting with wallet reputation to TRAVA token. Users with high TRAVA and TOD reputations might be of benefit when joining the Investment Committee. The Investment Committee might use our new feature, which will be introduced very soon in the future. And after that, the committee can make the decision to invest the Treasury in the projects that brings the most profit, which can be Trava Lending Pool.\n**Dr. Minh**\nSeems that the new feature is a useful tool for the TraDAO community to decide on their investment, we are looking forward to it. Can you give us the detail of the relationship between TraDAO and Trava Knight NFT?\n**Mr. Thang**\nOur new feature is indeed worth waiting for. About TraDAO and Knight NFT, as in the infographic, Investment Committee can mint veTOD, which acts as an NFT. Like veTRAVA, users can buy, sell and auction veTOD on the NFT marketplace. The auctioned veTOD might be used as collateral in Trava Lending Pool. The details of how the Investment Committee can mint veTOD will be announced very soon in the future. So, stay tuned for much excitement ahead.\n \n**Part 2: In-depth Discussion**\n\nTopic 3: Marketing development plan\n**Mr. Thang**\nPersonally, I think it’s reasonable when we focus on improving the quality of current features, as well as the communication and understanding among the community. So, Dr. Minh, let’s talk about our marketing and business development plan.\n**Dr. Minh**\nAbout Marketing, we have the orientation of growing organic Marketing. We try to organize internal events to improve the communication between the team and our community. These internal events are expected to update our community on what we are doing right now and to enhance trust among our community in this bearish sentiment.\nLast but not least, for Business, we also seek in-depth partnerships. On the foundation of the partnerships, we hope to attract more new users to our community. And as you know, this meetup will reveal the future partnership between us and TechFi, a website providing investors and developers with a strong foundation of technology in the cryptocurrency space. I hope this future partnership will be a win-win relationship, TechFi can help us attract users, and we can help TechFi in contributing informative articles or statistics.\n**Mr. Thang**\nReally insightful indeed! Can you outline the next specific actions for Marketing?\n**Dr. Minh**\nA lot is worth waiting ahead, Thang. I think I told enough about our brief vision, so now, with specific actions in Marketing, Ms.Quinn, I bet you will be really really ready to share?\n**Ms. Quinn**\nWell sure.\nMaybe many u guys here know that there are 3 main types of media funnels that are really important in digital marketing: owned (our social channels, website, or all the media we created, paid (like KOLs, influencers or ads on Twitter, gg search PPC…) and earned media (Feedback from users themselves or we can say the worth of mouth and the organic effect from the partnership). Reach a diverse audience through Paid Media, create engaging, customer-driven content and solve their problems on Owned Media, then encourage them to share, rate, or support the brand that is earned media.\nWith the current situation and based on our strategies, we will focus on owned media and earned media at the moment. Focus on the community power right now and discuss more with experts from outside of the team (Like today we have micelle here today). So, for now, it’s necessary to strengthen the communication activities in our community. We will be organizing internal actions, like meetups, community calls, user guide calls, etc., with the live version via Telegram, Discord, or Twitter Space, in order to create more opportunities for our users to directly talk to the product owners of Trava. All in all, we want to focus on customer services and loyal knights. The key or the atom of Trava is technology is the real team with a clear vision no matter how subjective factors, and we will always educate users about that. Thanks guys for always being here and realizing those points and always cheering us.\nWe hope that with these events, our community will get the latest update on what the team is doing, and we will build a better understanding between team and community through real conversation. I believe communication between team and community is of utmost importance in marketing strategy in this bearish moment.\n**Dr. Minh**\nVery nice Quinn, specific actions with a clear purpose.\n**Mr. Thang**\nIndeed. Apart from these internal events, are there any other events with other projects?\n**Ms. Quinn**\nNice question Thang, I’m about to talk about the potential partnership between Trava and TechFi. As Dr. Minh mentioned, we will soon collaborate with TechFi, an educational blog targeting people who are interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.\nActually, today, we invite a special guest, Ms. Michelle from TechFi, who will give you more detailed information about this blog and about the supportive relationship between the two of us.\nHi Michelle, I hope you’re doing well.\n \n**Part 2: In-depth Discussion**\n\nTopic 4: Business development plan — Partnership with TechFi\n**Ms. Michelle**\nHi Quinn, Hi everyone. I’m Michelle from TechFi. It’s such an honor to be here today with you guys and talk about our blog as well as the way to improve the marketing performance of both Trava and TechFi.\nJust like Dr. Minh and Mr. Thang have mentioned, the market now is not really good. The investors are losing their trust in some way. That’s why we need a wise vision, quick action, and reasonable solutions for the existing problems. It’s great to hear that you guys are doing well and have a clear vision.\n**Ms. Quinn**\nYes. For those who may not know about TechFi could you please give us some information about your blog?\n**Ms. Michelle**\nYeah. TechFi is an educational blog for those who care about the world of blockchain. I mean, the investors and developers as well.\nTo be more specific, we cover a lot of areas related to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. On our website, you will find this information in the form of news, long-form articles, and personal blogs. So many choices, I would say.\nWe mainly focus on deep analysis of blockchain projects and blockchain attack cases. By doing that, we provide readers with profound insights into this exciting world which help investors make the right decision and help the developers improve their careers.\n**Dr. Minh**\nThank you, Michelle. Actually, I suppose the form of educational blogs is quite common now, and there are several websites out there following this concept. So what differentiates TechFi from others?\n**Ms. Michelle**\nAs I just said, there are two main points we want to focus on, which are the deep analysis of different projects and attack cases. They are our unique selling points, actually.\nFor now, not many websites provide readers with a deep understanding of these attacks. But with TechFi, each of them will be described and analyzed thoroughly.\nNot only investors who care about their money safety but also developers who are working in the field of blockchain security will be interested in these topics.\n**Mr. Thang**\nIt sounds interesting, you know, people tend to think that the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency is full of risks, especially when the blockchain attack happens almost every day around the world. So I think the idea of bringing a better understanding of these attacks is incredible. People are fearful of something mainly because they don’t know about it, so if they know why, how these attacks happen, how to prevent them, and how to handle the bad situation, they may put their trust in the world of cryptocurrency.\n**Ms. Michelle**\nExactly! By giving users such useful information like that, we hope to gain their trust from them thus building a strong and loyal community.\n \n**Part 3: Ending**\n**Ms. Quinn**\nYeah! Thank you Dr. Minh, Mr. Thang and Michelle.\nLadies and gentlemen, I hope that through this close conversation today, you have gained useful information about the next steps of Trava Finance as well as TechFi.\nIn this bear market, I have to say. It’s quite hard to not be affected by negative feelings. However, we have been through several struggles since the beginning of the cryptocurrency wave. That’s why we have a reason to look at the bright sight. In the last words, thank you all for being here today. See you in the next episode.\n**Dr. Minh**\nThank you, hope this meet-up gives the community a better understanding of Trava and our development vision.\n**Mr. Thang**\nMy pleasure to be here today.

The longer they lock, the more voting power they possess. Vote locking allows you to vote in governance and receive rewards from special incentive programs.\n \n\n**What is veTRAVA?**\nveTRAVA stands for voting escrow Trava. It is an ERC721 token that acts as evidence of your locking token in the governance module. Every time users create a new lock, they receive a veTRAVA token, storing their locked balance, unlock time, and rewards amount.\nThe longer you lock your tokens, the more voting power you have (and the bigger incentive you can earn). For example, you can vote lock 1,000 TRAVA/rTRAVA for a year to have 250 voting power. Each token locked for four years is equal to 1 voting power.\nThe number of voting power you will receive depends on your locked balance & unlock time. \nThe minimum locking time is one week, and the maximum locking time is four years.\nYour voting power gradually decreases as your escrow tokens approach their lock expiry. The graph on Locker UI from Governance Portal illustrates the decrease process.\n \n\n**What can we do with veTRAVA?**\nWhile holding veTRAVA, you can vote for proposals to change the protocol with your voting power and earn rewards from incentive programs. Currently, veTRAVA holders will earn weekly rewards emission in Trava based on their voting power percentage. There will be proposals to enable sharing fees from protocol or boost rewards in the lending pool in the near future to enrich the veTRAVA incentive program.\n \n\n**Why do we need veTRAVA?**\nFirstly, veTRAVA represents the vote locking mechanism, which helps the protocol focus on encouraging ones who show strong commitment.\nSecondly, veTRAVA is designed as an ERC721 token, which opens a future secondary marketplace to avoid the decrease of liquidity on the market because of locking the Trava token.\n \n\n**How can I get veTRAVA?**\nYou can go to our Locker UI in Governance Portal to create a new veTRAVA lock.\nHere is the link to our user guide.\nPreviousDAONextVoting\nLast updated 2 years ago"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/governance/locker"", ""rrf_score"": 0.15476190476190477 }, { ""content"": ""**Lock your tokens for** veTRAVA\n \n\n**Lock your tokens for** veTRAVA\n\n**Lock Calculator**\nSelect the token you want to lock, input lock amount, and select unlock time to see how many voting power you will have.\n \n\n**Lock your tokens for** veTRAVA\n\n**Create new** veTRAVA**lock**\n1.

It is an ERC721 token that acts as evidence of your locking token in the governance module. Every time users create a new lock, they receive a veTRAVA token, storing their locked balance, unlock time, and rewards amount.\nThe longer you lock your tokens, the more voting power you have (and the bigger incentive you can earn).

🎯 How to Check Your Chance of Winning in Fortune Mining

✅ Step-by-Step Guide:
	1.	Go to Trava Station
🔗 https://station.trava.finance
	2.	Connect Your Wallet
	•	Use MetaMask or another Web3 wallet
	•	Make sure you’re on the BNB Chain
	3.	Navigate to the “Fortune Mining” Section
	4.	Scroll to “Your Position”
	•	You will see:
	•	🔢 Your ticket count
	•	📊 Total ticket count in the pool
	5.	Check Your Winning Chance (If Displayed)
	•	In some events, the estimated winning probability (%) is shown
	•	If not, you can manually estimate:
🧮 Estimated Chance of Winning

\text{Your Chance (%) } = \left( \frac{\text{Your Tickets}}{\text{Total Tickets}} \right) \times 100

⸻

🧠 Example

Metric	Value
Your Tickets	100
Total Tickets	10,000
Estimated Chance	(100 / 10,000) × 100 = 1%

Some pools may have multiple winners, in which case your chance may scale across different prize levels.

⸻

📌 Notes
	•	🕐 Chances update live as more users stake
	•	🧮 More tickets = higher chance
	•	🔁 Staking early or during bonus phases may increase ticket multipliers

⸻

Would you like a calculator tool that shows your chance of winning based on deposit size and pool stats?","To check your chance of winning in Trava Finance (e.g., in Fortune Mining, Knight Auctions, or NFT raffles), you’ll need to refer to the number of tickets you’ve earned and the total ticket pool. Your chance is typically calculated as:

Your Winning Chance (%) = (Your Tickets / Total Tickets) × 100

Here’s how to find and estimate it:

⸻

🎯 How to Check Your Chance of Winning in Trava

✅ 1. Go to the Trava App
	•	Open: https://app.trava.finance
	•	Navigate to:
	•	Fortune Mining
	•	Knight Auction
	•	Armoury Chest, depending on the campaign you’re in

⸻

✅ 2. Connect Your Wallet
	•	Use MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.
	•	Make sure you’re on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC)

⸻

✅ 3. Check Your Tickets
	•	In the relevant campaign (e.g., Fortune Mining pool or Auction), locate the section called:
	•	“Your Tickets” or
	•	“Your Entries”

⸻

✅ 4. Check Total Tickets
	•	Most campaign UIs will also show the total number of tickets across all users (e.g., “Total Pool Tickets”)

⸻

✅ 5. Calculate Your Probability

Use this simple formula:

Chance of Winning (%) = (Your Tickets / Total Tickets) × 100

🧠 Example:

	•	You have 500 tickets
	•	Total pool = 10,000 tickets
	•	→ Your chance: (500 / 10,000) × 100 = 5%

⸻

We will recalculate and update the price based on the price on the market, the initial price and the data analysis extracted from our NFT Marketplace.\n**Note that** with each wallet, the maximum number of Trava Knight NFT that can be deposited in**one vault** is **one** Knight NFT. For example, if you have two Trava Knight NFTs of Gold, for example, you can only stake one of them into Gold Vault to farm and earn $TRAVA rewards.\n_**With Copper, Silver and Gold Vault, if NFT owners withdraw their NFTs within 7 days, the farming rewards will decrease by 10%.**_\nKnights with a higher rarity can be deposited in vaults of a lower rarity. Continuing the example above, one of your Gold Knights can be deposited in Gold vault and the other can be deposited in either Copper vault or Silver vault and earn APR corresponding to those vaults.\nFurthermore, for Knight NFTs put in Farming vaults, we shall use the \""Polish Mechanism”. After depositing Knight NFTs in those vaults, users must check their Knights on a regular basis through the Farming site, which is considered a polishing action. If users never check their Knights, the Glossiness of their Knights will deteriorate, and the Farming rewards will drop. So, to maintain the rewards from Knight NFTs, NFT owners must perform \""polishing\"" action, which means check their NFTs in the vaults regularly. ###\n**Formula to calculate Farming rewards**\n _**How to calculate the rewards for Copper, Silver and Gold Vaults?**_\nEach vault has a value called _emissionPerSecond_. This is a fixed amount that all depositors will be rewarded when they deposit NFT per second. Therefore, the fewer number of people staking NFT, the more rewards each staker will get.\n_**How to calculate the rewards for Diamond and Crystal Vaults?**_\nThe Glossiness of each NFT starts off at 100%, but it gradually decreases over time, affecting the incentives received when users deposit their NFTs in the vault. Users must complete \""Polishing\"" acts in order to receive 100% of the rewards.\nThe amount of reward from NFT polishing shall be calculated using 2 parameters: _decayRate_ and _decayInterval_. Concretely, after a _decayInterval_ (a certain amount of time), if the NFT is not polished, the rewards for the next _decayInterval_ will be reduced (_decayRate_ , calculated in % will decrease)\nFor example: _decayInterval_ = 2 days and _decayRate_ = 10% indicates that: every two days without polishing, the rewards of the next day will be reduced (due to the NFT glossiness). Hence, after 20 days, the amount of rewards for NFT will be 0.\nIf you stake NFT for a period _t_ = 9, the amount of incentives that you probably get is 450 Trava (On average per day you will get 450/9 = 50). However, you have forgotten to polish for 9 days. Then, the amount of rewards you receive is only 370 Trava. The amount of incentive you get is described as below:\n**Minus Rewards**\n10%\n10%\n20%\n20%\n30%\n30%\n40%\n**Remaining Rewards(TRAVA)**\nThe detailed calculation us as follows: (X is the rewards NFT depositor will receive after t days)\nThe average rewards each day NFT staker will receive:\nm=m = \\frac{X}{t}\nNumber of _decayInterval_ that depositor have to go through:\nn=tdecayIntervaln = \\frac{t}{decayInterval}decayInterval​\nThe result of this calculation will be rounded down.\n * If n < , the rewards depositor will receive is: m t = X\n * If n 1decayInterval\\frac{1}{decayInterval}decayInterval​\n\n\nThe percentage of minus rewards you get at the end of decayInterval period:\np=(n−1)∗decayRatep = ( n - 1) *decayRatedecayRate\nThe total amount of incentives you will receive:\nm∗[(2−p)∗n∗decayInterval2+(t−n∗dacayInterval)∗(1−p−decayRate)]m *[ (2 - p ) * n * \\frac{decayInterval}{2} + (t - n * dacayInterval) * (1 - p - decayRate) ]decayInterval​+dacayInterval)∗decayRate)]\n * If 1decayRate\\frac{1}{decayRate} decayRate​< n:\n\n\nThe total amount of rewards you get:\nm∗(1decayRate+1)∗decayInterval2m * (\\frac{1}{decayRate} + 1 )* \\frac{decayInterval} {2} (decayRate​+decayInterval​\nIn the above example, we have _X = 450, t = 9_\nWe can calculate: _m = 50, n = 4, p= 0.3_\nPut into the formula, we get:\n50∗[(2−0.3)∗4∗+(9−4∗2)∗(1−0.3−0.1)]=37050 * [(2 - 0.3) * 4 * \\frac{2}{2} + (9 - 4 * 2) * (1 -0.3 -0.1) ] = 3700.3)∗0.1)]= ##\n**Heuristic Farming (Farming based on EXP)**\nWhen the new Farming mechanism commences, _**our 5 current Farming vaults will stop distributing TRAVA as reward**_ , which means our 5 existing vaults will only give back EXP (one EXP for each second in 5 current farming vaults). This change supports NFT owners to gain EXP to enter Heuristic Farming with better rewards.\nIn the new Farming mechanism, we provide 5 more vaults for Heuristic Farming, and you can deposit as many knights as you want into each Vault, provided that those knights have the same rarity as that Vault. Rewards from Heuristic Farming are **rTRAVA tokens and EXP** (one EXP for every 3 seconds in the vault). The higher EXP, the higher the APR, the higher the rTRAVA reward.\n**Normal Farming**\n**Heuristic Farming**\nNumber of vaults\n5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities\n5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities\nNumber of Knights allowed in one vault\n1 Knight\n1 Knight\nReward in tokens\nNone\nrTRAVA\nEXP reward\nOne EXP is released for each second Knights in the vaults\nOne EXP is released for 3 second Knights in the vaults\nWith the new and improved mechanism, the EXP points are a crucial element in the development of the Trava Knight NFT journey. Like the current Farming mechanism, Heuristic Farming also has a Polishing mechanism. The polishing mechanism in Heuristic Farming helps NFT owners maintain 100% rewards and supports increasing EXP and APY.\nNote that, Knights with 0 EXP still gain rewards from Heuristic Farming. Moreover, with rTRAVA from Heuristic Farming, users can auto-stake in our rTRAVA with no locking period in our Staking Program. rTRAVA then can be locked in Trava Governance vault to gain locking power as veTRAVA and earn more rewards. ###\n**Calculation Formula of Emission Per Second**\nFrom now on, the eps will automatically change depending on the number of Knight NFTs and their EXP. For particular, the equation is demonstrated as below:\nWith the following parameters:\n_eps: Emission Per Second_\n _x: The number of Knights in the vault_\n _X: The starting eps_\n _Y: The maximum eps that can be reached_\n _Z: The eps will converge, when the number of Knight NFTs increases in the vault_\n _m: The number of Knight NFTs in the vault that own eps reaches the maximum rate (Y)_\n_u:__is calculated as_\n _a: is calculated as_\na=2∗∗(m−1)a = 2 * \\frac{Y - Z}{u + 1} * (m-1)​∗\n _b: is calculated as_\nb=u∗(m−1)b = \\frac{u}{u + 1} * (m-1)\n_c: is calculated as_\nc=(c = (\\frac{m-1}{u + 1})^{2} (​\nFor example, We have the following parameters:\nThe starting eps is 100 Trava/s\n _X_ = 100\nThe maximum eps is 400 Trava/s at the rate of 1000 NFTs\n _Y = 400_\n _m = 1000_\nThe eps will converge at 250 Trava/s when the number of NFTs passes\n _Z_ = 250\nThe chart is presented as below:\nFrom the chart, we can see that when there are little NFTs in the vault then the eps is low, and continuously increases when the number of NFTs in the vault reaches a certain rate. After that, the eps start to decrease and converge to a certain rate. ###\n**Calculation Value of NFT**\nThe value of NFT depends on its EXP:\nFor specific, the formula is calculated as below:\nvalue=86400+100value = \\frac{exp}{86400} + 100value=86400​+\n_Note_ :\n_exp:_ EXP of the NFT\n _value:_ The Value of the NFT\nFor example:\nWith NFT that has _**0 EXP**_ : Its Value will be _**100**_\nWith NFT has _**864000 EXP**_ : Its Value will be _**110**_\nWith NFT has _**8640000 EXP**_ : Its Value will be _**200**_\nBecause, in every 3 seconds, the NFT can earn 1 EXP, the NFT needs 259200 seconds or almost 3 days to increase 1 Value.\n**NOTE:** In order not to waste BNB, users should Polish the NFT in at least 3 days. ###\nAPR Calculation Formula for NFT\nAPR of a Knight NFT depends on 4 elements:\neps: Emission Per Second\nvalue: The EXP Value of Knight\ntotalValue: The Total Value of the total number of Knights in Vault\nprice: The price of Knight based on the weekly recalculation\n _**For specific, the formula is:**_\nAPR=eps∗valuetotalValue∗price∗24∗60∗60∗365∗100%APR = \\frac{eps * value}{totalValue*price} *24*60*60*365*100\\%totalValue∗priceeps∗value​∗100%\n_**For example,**_ there are 4 Knight NFTs with the similar rarity in 1 vault with the EXP in turn of 0, 86400, 864000, 8640000.\neps: 0.05 TRAVA per second\nThe rarity of the Knight is Diamond, which is priced at 150000 TRAVA\nTherefore, APR will be calculated as below:\n**Knight 1**\n**Knight 2**\n**Knight 3**\n**Knight 4**\n**totalValue**\nEXP\n86400\n864000\n8640000\nValue\n100\n101\n110\n200\n= 511\nAPR\n205.71%\n205.77%\n226.29%\n411.43%\nPreviousTrava NFT MarketplaceNextTrade-up Mechanism\nLast updated 2 years ago"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/nfts/trava-nft-farming"", ""rrf_score"": 0.11805555555555555 }, { ""content"": ""Following the Reward mechanism, 40% of users' rewards will be put in the vesting pool and be claimed gradually.\n * The winner can claim their reward every 24 hours.\n * The vesting percentage will be calculated:\n\n\nClaimablereward=RemainingReward∗%ClaimClaimable reward = Remaining Reward * \\% Claim Claimablereward=RemainingReward∗%Claim\n _The % claim depends on the number of referees that this winner invites to the game (referral mechanism)_\nRef\nClaim\n10%\n15%\n25%\n40%\n100%\nPreviousRewards MechanismNextLeaderboard mechanism\nLast updated 1 year ago"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/pottery-mechanism/rewards-mechanism/vesting-pool-mechanism"", ""rrf_score"": 0.1125 }, { ""content"": ""##\nChecking profile\nClick on your account number to access the profile page:\nOn the profile page, you will know the information about your level, the amount of rewards earned and claimed, the number of people referred, and your quiz packages organized by their status:\n * Pending (your finished quiz packages waiting to end)\n * Claimable (your quiz packages that ended but you have not received the reward)\n * Claimed (your quiz packages that you have received rewards)\n * Lost (quiz packages for which you do not receive a reward) ##\nRewards Mechanism\nYou can read more details about the rewards mechanism of the Pottery here. ###\nVesting Pool\nThis includes 40% of Pottery’s total reward, which you can claim daily (24 hours), with the amount depending on the number of friends you have successfully invited to join Pottery.

The relevant information is shown depending on the type of method used in the step (staking, depositing, borrowing, providing liquidity pair, swapping). All of them are real-time data collected by BRicher that can save time in making decisions.\nThere are three methods to make a strategy: manual investing, semi-auto investing and auto investing. The basic difference between these three is the level that BRicher supports you to make your investment.\n * Manual Investing: You need to access each DApps to implement each step by yourself.\n * Semi-auto Investing: You only need to stay on the BRicher site, and for each step, you simply click on an “Execute” button. \n * Auto Investing: All you need to do is click on one button to authorize BRicher to complete the whole process.\n\n\n\n**Auto investing**\n**Step 1.** Fill in the amount of capital you want to invest\n**Step 2.** Click the “Auto Invest” button\nAfter that, a list of steps and gas fee information will appear\nMake sure you will check all this information\n**Step 3.** To make an investment, click the “Approve” button to delegate BRicher to finish the whole progress for you.\n**Step 4.** After approving the progress successfully, click the “Execute” button.\n_Notes: - After all these steps, you still need to keep track of the progress status:_ + _The completed step: Turning Green + Unsuccessful step: Turning yellow as a warning notification. Once that happens, there will be an instruction pop-up window. In this case, you can follow this instruction to continue investing or cancel the whole process. - Because of the typical requirements of each DApp, there will be some strategies that can not be invested automatically (Only Manual Investing and Semi-auto Investing are available)__- Users can only execute one investment strategy at one time. That means they must finish or cancel the previous investing progress if they want to implement the other plans. Users can implement their strategies and quit the page in the middle. We support them in resuming the implementation process.

Moreover, unlike other aggregators, BRicher lets investors own their tokens so that they can take complete control of capital and investment plans._\n \nThe first version of BRicher\nIn the first version, BRicher provided users with effective investment strategies with high returns and helped them keep track of their diaries (ROI and other critical parameters).\n_An investment strategy suggested by BRicher_\nHowever, the problem is that after discovering their best investment suggestion, users need to implement all the investing processes by themself, which is significantly time-consuming. Additionally, some “newbies” unfamiliar with various DApps may find it challenging to accomplish complicated operations independently.\nTo address these problems and provide users with more optimized options, we would like to offer new functions: Auto Investing and Semi-auto Investing.\nAs their name — “Auto”- these two new functions will automatically simplify the investment process and save investors much time.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n** _What is the Semi-auto Investing function?_**\n_Semi-auto Investing is a new feature that allows users to finish different stages of the investment strategies directly on the BRicher interface rather than on other DApps._\nIn more detail, recommended strategies usually consist of several steps, each with smaller operations. Performing all of these tasks in multiple DApps can be challenging and time-consuming.\nIn this case, the Semi-auto Investing function supports users effectively by allowing them to gradually execute the strategies on only one site — BRicher. That means even though users still need to invest step by step, there will be one button for each stage on BRicher’s interface for them to click on and complete the process easier.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n**_What benefit does it bring to users?_**\n * It is much more convenient than the Manual Investing feature, which requires users to access each DApps and execute the required steps.\n * Investors can control and keep track of each step of the investment implementation. That helps them to deeply understand the progress and, more importantly, make the modification in each step (cancel, for example) if necessary.\n\n\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What is the Auto Investing function?_**\nUpgraded from Semi-auto Investing, the Auto investing function requires users nothing but to click one only button. By doing that, the user authorizes BRicher to fully automate every phase of the investing strategy.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What benefits does it bring to users?_**\n * The implementation of investment plans is made simpler by condensing complicated multi-step procedures into a single button.\n * Compared to Manual investing and Semi-auto Investing, this function saves considerable time and effort for users.\n\n\n \nThe fundamental difference between these two functions\nFor a better understanding of the essential difference between Auto investing and Semi-auto Investing, let us take an example:\nAssuming that BRicher suggests users implement an investment plan that includes two main steps:\n * Swap their tokens to TRAVA on PancakeSwap\n * Stake TRAVA on the Trava governance vault to earn rewards and voting power.\n\n\nWith the Semi-auto Investing function, there will be two execute buttons corresponding two steps mentioned. In this case, investors can finish the investment process simply by clicking on these two buttons.\nWith the Auto investing function, the progress is even more optimized when they only need to click on one button.\n_Notes that: Unlike other Aggregators, Bricher does not hold investors’ tokens.

Exciting information on each strategy, such as its current ROI, ROI history, transaction fee, and reward tokens, are shown on the table. In addition, you can select a row to get detailed information on the respective strategy.\nAt the right upper corner of the page, you can enter your favorite token to filter strategies.\nTo sort the strategies, you can press on the table headers.\n \n**Strategy Exploring**\nTo use the _Strategy Exploring_ page, you must connect your wallet first.\nChoose wallet\nAfter authenticating your wallet, you will see a screen like this:\nYou can search for high-return investment strategies based on your input tokens on the Strategy Exploring page. Please follow the following steps:\n**Step 1**. Select the token you want to invest\n**Step 2**. Select “**More setting** ” to filter the recommended strategies\nFirst, you can sort strategies by safety index, ROI, or a number of steps.\nYou can set the limit for the number of steps used in your strategies. Strategies with a low number of steps are typically safer, but strategies with a high number of steps are usually more profitable.\nBy default, recommended strategies use all yield farming methods. If you do not like a specific method, please deselect it.\nSome vaults/pools offer very high ROI, thus dominating the recommended strategies. To explore the other strategies that do not include these vaults/pools, you can add the reward tokens of the vaults/pools to the control.\n**Step 3**. Click the “ _Make strategies_ ” button\nOur **algorithm** will automatically compute and return appropriate strategies for you. You should pay more attention to the strategy title (which includes names of used DApps), the safety index, the number of steps, and the Return On Investment rate.\n**Step 4** : If you are interested in a strategy, please click its _“Check detail and Invest”_ button\nBRicher will show general information on the strategy, such as its start and expiration date, reward tokens, estimated gas, ROI history, etc.\nBRicher also displays all helpful information on each step. The relevant information is shown depending on the type of method used in the step (staking, depositing, borrowing, providing liquidity pair, swapping). All of them are real-time data collected by BRicher that can save your time in making decisions.\nAt this version of BRicher, please follow the instruction to invest manually by yourselves. Then you click on the “manual invest” button, enter the amount of token you have invested, and press the confirm button. BRicher will save your strategies so that you can monitor the strategy’s effectiveness (the capital, the interest, the reward token, the ROIs, etc.)\nIn the next version of BRicher, we will automatically implement the strategy for you, but you still own your tokens.

Step 1. To use the Strategy Exploring page, you must connect and authenticate your wallet first:

- Then click the “Authenticate” button.
Step 2. Select the token you prefer to invest in by clicking one option under the line “Select token to invest”.

Step 3. Select “More setting” to filter the recommended strategies

First, you can sort strategies by safety index, ROI, or the number of steps of the strategies.

You can also set the limit for the number of steps used in your strategies. Strategies with a low number of steps are typically safer, but strategies with a high number of steps are usually more profitable.

By default, recommended strategies are automatically composed of all yield farming methods. If you do not like a specific method, please deselect it.

Some vaults/pools offer very high ROI, and they thus dominate the recommended strategies. To explore the other strategies that DO NOT include these vaults/pools, you can add the reward tokens of the vaults/pools to the control.

Step 4. Click the “Make strategies” button

As a result, it is challenging to crawl data from different projects, come up with the best investing strategy, and more importantly, implement it.\nIn this case, aggregators do exactly what their name suggested — aggregating information and combining all investing activities into one place. That allows users quickly make decisions and invest with simple steps, saving them considerable time and effort.\n> **_BRicher,_****_developed by_**** _Trava Finance_**** _is an aggregator._**\nHowever, differentiated from others, BRicher offers users multiple investing methods: providing liquidity, swapping, staking, depositing, and borrowing in the lending pools, etc. Moreover, it also supports investors well in exploring and monitoring their investment strategies. Details are in the following parts. # What differentiate BRicher from others?\n_In addition to the benefits that common aggregators bring to investors, BRicher offers them unique and one-of-a-kind utilities:_\n**Various types of investment strategies**\nBRicher considers all types of yield farmings: Data on many liquidity providers, lending, borrowing, and staking protocols are all collected and evaluated so that the aggregator can build up high-return investment strategies and share the best ones with investors.\nDifferent investing strategies recommended to users\n**Detailed and transparent information**\nWhile other aggregators don’t usually publicize their investment plans, BRicher assures all information on the recommended investment strategy is visible to users. All relevant information is collected and put in a single place, called BRicher’s Investment Portfolio, for investors in the most intuitive manner. Thus, they can easily verify the recommended plan by themselves.\nMoreover, instead of sharing the real-time ROI only, BRicher reveals the historical ROI of every investment plan. The ROI history and the AI-based safety index provide investors with valuable information before deciding whether to stick to the plan or not.\n**Composite strategies: an automatic combination of multiple types of investment strategies**\nMost current aggregators focus on providing simple-choice investment strategies with a single action (e.g., staking, depositing, or providing liquidity pairs). Although some of them are able to suggest composite strategies composed of multiple investing activities, these plans are typically built in a manual manner. That leads to some limitations as follows:\n * **Limited options:** recommended strategies might not be applicable to the investors’ tokens.\n * **Outdate investing strategies** : As it takes time to manually create new high-return investment strategies, they are not updated with the better ones.\n * **Unpublished information:** the manual-created strategy operates as a black box to users and thus it is challenging for them to evaluate such a strategy and put their trust in it.\n\n\nAddressing these problems, BRicher has developed innovative algorithms that build up the best strategies based on the custom inputs of investors. They can be either single-action strategies or **composite strategies (** consisting of a series of actions). Furthermore, BRicher provides thorough information on each action so that users can easily check, estimate, and make their own choices.\n**Allowing users to keep track of their own investment process**\nLastly, BRicher allows investors to add an investment plan to their investing diaries. They hence can keep track of all of their plans: monitoring how their ROI goes up and down and checking how much they have earned. In addition, they will also receive notifications as soon as their strategies are going to expire or there have been other strategies with higher ROI than the current one. # **BRicher and our long-term vision**\nBRicher is developed in two phases. In the first phase, it supports investors collect relevant and detailed information and come up with the best investment plans.\nIn the second one, it will help users to cut off their “money-making process” even more, by allowing them to implement various tradings and transactions “all-in-one-click” with Auto investing and Semi-auto investing functions.\nAs our long-term vision is to implement a fully decentralized lending marketplace where users can own their lending pools, BRicher plays a significant role in supporting both pool owners and those who invest in these pools.\nBRicher also supports in managing their treasury investment portfolios which maintain the sustainable development of the protocol and thus benefit TOD holders in the long-term.\nFurthermore, as it is capable of combining multiple yield farming methods to offer the best investment strategies to investors, we expect BRicher to go further beyond the Trava ecosystem to foster the development of the DeFi world."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-bricher-light-up-your-path-to-be-richer-2e1b42a111e7?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----58-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""##\nI \n**Input token** The type of token investors spend as initial capital.\n**Investment Diaries** A Function that allows users to save and track their investment plans. ##\nM \n**Manually invest** Manually investing means you follow our instructions step by step to implement the strategy. ##\nN \n**Number of steps** The number of investment steps included in a suggested strategy. ##\nO \n**Output token** The type of token investors receive as benefits from the investment strategy. \n**One-step strategy** An investment plan that usually consists of only one investment action (with a particular method)."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/glossary/bricher-glossary"", ""rrf_score"": 0.06315789473684211 }, { ""content"": ""###\n**“BRicher diaries” section**\nBRicher lists all of your investment strategies on this page.\nYou can change the name of a strategy to recognize it easily by clicking the “Pen” icon and also delete a strategy with the “Trash bin” icon.\nTo get detailed information on a strategy, please click the “Detail” button.\nIn addition to the basic information, BRicher helps you to estimate your interest in this strategy based on your original capital and the ROI history.\nThe ROI History is illustrated in a chart.

Moreover, unlike other aggregators, BRicher lets investors own their tokens so that they can take complete control of capital and investment plans._\n \nThe first version of BRicher\nIn the first version, BRicher provided users with effective investment strategies with high returns and helped them keep track of their diaries (ROI and other critical parameters).\n_An investment strategy suggested by BRicher_\nHowever, the problem is that after discovering their best investment suggestion, users need to implement all the investing processes by themself, which is significantly time-consuming. Additionally, some “newbies” unfamiliar with various DApps may find it challenging to accomplish complicated operations independently.\nTo address these problems and provide users with more optimized options, we would like to offer new functions: Auto Investing and Semi-auto Investing.\nAs their name — “Auto”- these two new functions will automatically simplify the investment process and save investors much time.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n** _What is the Semi-auto Investing function?_**\n_Semi-auto Investing is a new feature that allows users to finish different stages of the investment strategies directly on the BRicher interface rather than on other DApps._\nIn more detail, recommended strategies usually consist of several steps, each with smaller operations. Performing all of these tasks in multiple DApps can be challenging and time-consuming.\nIn this case, the Semi-auto Investing function supports users effectively by allowing them to gradually execute the strategies on only one site — BRicher. That means even though users still need to invest step by step, there will be one button for each stage on BRicher’s interface for them to click on and complete the process easier.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n**_What benefit does it bring to users?_**\n * It is much more convenient than the Manual Investing feature, which requires users to access each DApps and execute the required steps.\n * Investors can control and keep track of each step of the investment implementation. That helps them to deeply understand the progress and, more importantly, make the modification in each step (cancel, for example) if necessary.\n\n\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What is the Auto Investing function?_**\nUpgraded from Semi-auto Investing, the Auto investing function requires users nothing but to click one only button. By doing that, the user authorizes BRicher to fully automate every phase of the investing strategy.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What benefits does it bring to users?_**\n * The implementation of investment plans is made simpler by condensing complicated multi-step procedures into a single button.\n * Compared to Manual investing and Semi-auto Investing, this function saves considerable time and effort for users.\n\n\n \nThe fundamental difference between these two functions\nFor a better understanding of the essential difference between Auto investing and Semi-auto Investing, let us take an example:\nAssuming that BRicher suggests users implement an investment plan that includes two main steps:\n * Swap their tokens to TRAVA on PancakeSwap\n * Stake TRAVA on the Trava governance vault to earn rewards and voting power.\n\n\nWith the Semi-auto Investing function, there will be two execute buttons corresponding two steps mentioned. In this case, investors can finish the investment process simply by clicking on these two buttons.\nWith the Auto investing function, the progress is even more optimized when they only need to click on one button.\n_Notes that: Unlike other Aggregators, Bricher does not hold investors’ tokens.

Select “**More setting** ” to filter the recommended strategies\nFirst, you can sort strategies by safety index, ROI, or a number of steps.\nYou can set the limit for the number of steps used in your strategies. Strategies with a low number of steps are typically safer, but strategies with a high number of steps are usually more profitable.\nBy default, recommended strategies use all yield farming methods. If you do not like a specific method, please deselect it.\nSome vaults/pools offer very high ROI, thus dominating the recommended strategies. To explore the other strategies that do not include these vaults/pools, you can add the reward tokens of the vaults/pools to the control.\n**Step 3**.

Moreover, unlike other aggregators, BRicher lets investors own their tokens so that they can take complete control of capital and investment plans._\n \nThe first version of BRicher\nIn the first version, BRicher provided users with effective investment strategies with high returns and helped them keep track of their diaries (ROI and other critical parameters).\n_An investment strategy suggested by BRicher_\nHowever, the problem is that after discovering their best investment suggestion, users need to implement all the investing processes by themself, which is significantly time-consuming. Additionally, some “newbies” unfamiliar with various DApps may find it challenging to accomplish complicated operations independently.\nTo address these problems and provide users with more optimized options, we would like to offer new functions: Auto Investing and Semi-auto Investing.\nAs their name — “Auto”- these two new functions will automatically simplify the investment process and save investors much time.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n** _What is the Semi-auto Investing function?_**\n_Semi-auto Investing is a new feature that allows users to finish different stages of the investment strategies directly on the BRicher interface rather than on other DApps._\nIn more detail, recommended strategies usually consist of several steps, each with smaller operations. Performing all of these tasks in multiple DApps can be challenging and time-consuming.\nIn this case, the Semi-auto Investing function supports users effectively by allowing them to gradually execute the strategies on only one site — BRicher. That means even though users still need to invest step by step, there will be one button for each stage on BRicher’s interface for them to click on and complete the process easier.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n**_What benefit does it bring to users?_**\n * It is much more convenient than the Manual Investing feature, which requires users to access each DApps and execute the required steps.\n * Investors can control and keep track of each step of the investment implementation. That helps them to deeply understand the progress and, more importantly, make the modification in each step (cancel, for example) if necessary.\n\n\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What is the Auto Investing function?_**\nUpgraded from Semi-auto Investing, the Auto investing function requires users nothing but to click one only button. By doing that, the user authorizes BRicher to fully automate every phase of the investing strategy.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What benefits does it bring to users?_**\n * The implementation of investment plans is made simpler by condensing complicated multi-step procedures into a single button.\n * Compared to Manual investing and Semi-auto Investing, this function saves considerable time and effort for users.\n\n\n \nThe fundamental difference between these two functions\nFor a better understanding of the essential difference between Auto investing and Semi-auto Investing, let us take an example:\nAssuming that BRicher suggests users implement an investment plan that includes two main steps:\n * Swap their tokens to TRAVA on PancakeSwap\n * Stake TRAVA on the Trava governance vault to earn rewards and voting power.\n\n\nWith the Semi-auto Investing function, there will be two execute buttons corresponding two steps mentioned.

problem with semantic chunking,What is the reward mechanism of Trava Pottery?,"The reward mechanism of Trava Pottery is a gamified staking system where users deposit TRAVA tokens into “pottery jars” and receive randomized rewards at the end of each round. The system is designed to incentivize participation through both guaranteed returns and lottery-style bonuses.

⸻

🏺 Trava Pottery Reward Mechanism – How It Works

🔹 1. Deposit Phase
	•	Users lock TRAVA tokens into an active “jar” during the entry period
	•	Each deposit counts as a “ticket” or participation unit

⸻

🔹 2. Lock Period
	•	Tokens are locked for a fixed period (e.g., 7 or 30 days)
	•	During this time, you cannot withdraw or modify your stake

⸻

🔹 3. Reward Distribution Phase (End of Jar Cycle)

Type of Reward	Description
🎯 Randomized Bonuses	A number of random winners are chosen from participants. These winners receive high-yield rewards, which come from the jar’s prize pool.
🛡️ Base Yield / Insurance Return	Non-winning participants may still receive a small base reward or yield, so no one leaves completely empty-handed (varies per jar).
🔁 Your Deposit Returned	All users, win or lose, get their original TRAVA tokens back after the round ends.


⸻

🎁 Example (Illustrative)
	•	Total Pottery Jar: 1,000,000 TRAVA
	•	Participants: 1,000
	•	Top Rewards: 10 users randomly selected to receive 5,000–20,000 TRAVA
	•	Non-Winners: May get 1–2% base APR return
	•	Your deposit: 1,000 TRAVA → Returned + reward (if selected)

⸻

📌 Key Features

Feature	Details
🔒 Lock-up	Required during the jar cycle (fixed duration)
🎰 Random Draw	Boosted reward winners selected randomly
💰 Fair Return	Everyone gets their principal back
🎯 Strategy	More you deposit → higher chance to win (but still randomized)


⸻

🧠 Good to Know
	•	Rewards are distributed automatically at the end of the cycle
	•	Winning odds increase with larger deposits, but luck still plays a role
	•	You can join multiple jars to diversify your chances

⸻

Would you like help estimating your expected returns based on deposit size and jar reward pool?","The reward mechanism of Trava Pottery is designed as a lottery-style yield protocol where participants lock their TRAVA tokens into a prize pool for a fixed period and receive a chance-based reward. It combines staking, randomized reward distribution, and DeFi gamification.

⸻

🎯 Key Elements of Trava Pottery’s Reward Mechanism

🏦 1. Locking Mechanism
	•	Users deposit TRAVA tokens into a Pottery pool.
	•	Tokens are locked for a specific duration (e.g., 7, 14, or 30 days).
	•	Locking more TRAVA = higher number of tickets = better odds.

⸻

🎟 2. Ticket-Based Lottery System
	•	Every deposited TRAVA earns you lottery tickets.
	•	After the pool closes, the protocol randomly selects winners based on ticket distribution.
	•	Rewards are not guaranteed — it’s probability-based.

⸻

🎁 3. Reward Types

Rewards vary by pool but can include:

Reward Type	Description
🪙 TRAVA	Fixed or variable amount of TRAVA tokens
🧠 EXP Points	Used in Trava gamification & leveling systems
🛡️ NFTs	Knight NFTs or Armoury items (for gameplay)
🎟 Bonus Entries	For future Pottery rounds


⸻

🔁 4. Periodic Events
	•	Pottery pools are run in recurring rounds (e.g., weekly).
	•	Each round has a unique pool size, prize pool, and reward structure.

⸻

🧠 5. Optional Boost via veTRAVA
	•	Holding or locking veTRAVA may give you:
	•	Extra ticket weight
	•	Access to premium pools
	•	Better odds or higher payout tiers

⸻

🧮 Example: How Rewards Work

Let’s say a Pottery pool has:
	•	100,000 TRAVA total locked
	•	10,000 TRAVA reward pool
	•	You lock 5,000 TRAVA

Your chance = 5,000 / 100,000 = 5% chance of winning a slice of the 10,000 TRAVA reward, based on random draw and number of winners.

⸻

📌 Summary Table

Component	Description
🎟 Tickets	Based on TRAVA amount locked
🎁 Rewards	TRAVA, EXP, NFTs, or bonus benefits
🧠 veTRAVA Boost	Increases odds or reward multiplier
🔁 Rounds	New pools launched regularly (with variable conditions)
🎲 Randomized Winner	Rewards distributed via fair lottery-style draw

In this case, veTRAVA, in the form of NFT, represents this power and is determined by the time and amount of locked tokens (as they show your commitment toward the future of Trava Finance).\nWith the implementation of the Trava Governance Vault, users can lock their TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB into this vault to receive a certain amount of veTRAVA representing their powers: the more veTRAVA you own, the higher your voting power in the Trava ecosystem. ## The Benefits Of Owning veTRAVA\nThe key value of veTRAVA is its representative of users’ power and their commitment to the project. As a result, in the long term, users who own veTRAVA can receive significant benefits:\n * Deciding on crucial parameters such as LTV, risk parameters, etc., in the lending pools (Trava Lending Pool and Users-owned Pools).\n * Receiving share profit coming from the fee charged by borrowers\n * Receiving boosting rewards **in rTRAVA** by providing liquidity and holding veTRAVA at the same time.\n * Earning TRAVA reward: the APR will be revealed soon.\n\n\nAs mentioned, veTRAVA is utilized as a form of NFT. For now, it can only be available for those who lock their token into the Governance Vault. However, it will be exchanged peer-to-peer with the launch of veTRAVA Marketplace. # veTRAVA Marketplace: Overview\nAs its name suggests, the veTRAVA marketplace is for users to buy and sell their veTRAVA. It means they can freely exchange their voting power. The main reason we came up with this idea is to optimize users’ experience, bringing them as much freedom as possible.

,How reasonable prices of veTRAVA are set?,"Setting a reasonable price for your veTRAVA NFT on the Trava Marketplace involves balancing several key factors that affect its value to potential buyers. Since veTRAVA represents locked TRAVA + voting power, its price depends on time, amount, and strategic value in governance or reward boosting.

⸻

🎯 How Are Reasonable Prices for veTRAVA Set?

There is no fixed formula, but reasonable pricing is typically based on:

⸻

🧮 1. Locked TRAVA Value
	•	Start with the amount of TRAVA locked in the veTRAVA position
	•	This acts as the base value (e.g., 5,000 TRAVA locked ≈ 5,000 TRAVA floor price)

⸻

⏳ 2. Remaining Lock Duration
	•	Longer lock = more valuable (due to higher veTRAVA voting power)
	•	Positions nearing unlock are less valuable since buyers wait less to retrieve tokens
	•	Discount usually increases as unlock time decreases

⸻

📈 3. veTRAVA Voting Power
	•	Buyers may pay more for larger veTRAVA balances to boost:
	•	Voting power in governance
	•	Yield in staking/dilution rewards
	•	Weight in BRicher optimization

⸻

📊 4. Market Conditions
	•	Compare similar veTRAVA listings:
	•	veTRAVA amount
	•	Unlock date
	•	Price
	•	Undercutting by 5–10% can increase your chances of a quick sale

⸻

🔄 5. Liquidity and Buyer Demand
	•	When governance or veTRAVA rewards are active, demand may rise
	•	In off-seasons, buyers may expect higher discounts

⸻

📌 Typical Pricing Guidelines

Scenario	Suggested Price
🔒 Long lock (6–12 mo)	85–100% of locked TRAVA value
⏳ Near unlock (1–2 mo)	60–75% of locked TRAVA value
🎯 High veTRAVA power	Can justify a premium above base TRAVA
🧊 Low demand market	Discount 20–30% to increase liquidity


⸻

🧠 Pro Tip

Before listing, ask:
	•	Would you buy your veTRAVA at that price?
	•	Does the listing offer a clear benefit to the buyer (e.g., yield boost, voting boost)?
	•	Can you bundle value (e.g., staking rewards or merge opportunities)?

⸻

Would you like to simulate a fair listing price for your specific veTRAVA NFT (just tell me amount + unlock time)?","Setting reasonable prices for veTRAVA on the marketplace involves evaluating the value of the locked TRAVA, remaining lock duration, and voting/reward power the NFT provides. Since veTRAVA is a tokenized NFT representation of locked TRAVA, its price reflects both intrinsic token value and utility premium.

⸻

🎯 How to Set a Reasonable Price for veTRAVA

🔢 1. Base Price = Locked TRAVA Value

Start by calculating the raw value of the locked TRAVA:

📌 Example:
5,000 TRAVA locked → Base price ≈ 5,000 TRAVA

But that’s just the minimum value — it doesn’t reflect lock time or utility.

⸻

⏳ 2. Adjust Based on Lock Duration

The longer the remaining lock, the more voting power and mining boost the veTRAVA offers.

Lock Time Left	Suggested Premium Range
< 1 month	No premium / Slight discount
1–6 months	Base + 5–15% premium
6–18 months	Base + 10–30% premium
> 18 months	Base + 25–50% premium


⸻

🧠 3. Factor in Governance & Reward Utility

veTRAVA gives access to:
	•	🗳 Voting power (governance)
	•	💰 Boosted rewards in Fortune Mining
	•	🎯 Eligibility for certain staking/NFT events

If governance is active or mining APR is high, buyers may accept a higher premium.

⸻

📊 4. Benchmark Against Other Listings

Before setting your price:
	•	Visit the veTRAVA Marketplace
	•	Compare NFTs with similar amount + unlock time
	•	Stay competitive — overpricing = no sales

⸻

🧮 5. Optional: Use Pricing Formula

Reasonable Price = Locked TRAVA + (Remaining Lock Time % × Premium Rate)

Example:
	•	4,000 TRAVA locked
	•	18 months remaining (≈38% of max lock)
	•	Apply 30% premium
→ Price = 4,000 + (4,000 × 0.30) = 5,200 TRAVA

⸻

📌 Summary: Factors to Consider

Factor	Effect on Price
🔒 Locked TRAVA	Base value (minimum)
⏳ Lock duration left	Longer = more value = higher price
🗳 Governance utility	High activity = more demand for voting power
💹 Mining boost	Valuable during high-APR Fortune Mining campaigns
📈 Marketplace trends	Must remain competitive to attract buyers

Moreover, now with the new mechanism of Liquidity Pool for TRAVA/Ticket, the Marketplace is becoming more and more attractive than ever! Let’s have a better understanding of The Ticket Marketplace before it launches._ # What is Ticket Marketplace?\nTicket Marketplace is where users can come to buy or sell Tickets. Just like other NFT Marketplaces, this platform supports peer-to-peer transactions, in which sellers can determine the Ticket prices and buyers can freely choose the suitable prices to buy.\nMoreover, in order to celebrate the events of Presale and Public Offering, Ticket Marketplace applies the Liquidity Pool mechanism, including swapping and providing liquidity, so that users can gain additional profits. # Ticket Marketplace Sell and Buy Mechanisms\nSimilar to other NFT Marketplaces, the Trava Ticket Marketplace basis mechanism supports peer-to-peer transactions. Sellers can set their own preferred prices for Tickets and sell them. Moreover, sellers can pay an extra fee in TRAVA to pin their Tickets on the top page and attract more buyers. Sellers can set the Ticket prices and gain more profit depending on the gap between the selling price and purchasing cost.\nIn terms of buyers, they can find good Ticket prices on the Marketplace to purchase. Instead of buying from the Counter, buyers can freely choose the Ticket on the Marketplace at a much more affordable price.\nThis Sell and Buy Mechanism of Ticket Marketplace can be applied for all three types of Tickets, including Counter Ticket, Presale Ticket, and Incentive Ticket. # Presale Ticket/TRAVA Pool\nAfter the Presale and the ongoing Public Offering, Trava Team has decided to implement a Liquidity Pool in the Ticket Marketplace. This mechanism consists of 2 main actions, swapping and providing liquidity.\n**‼️ Note:** **This pool is FIRST APPLIED FOR PRESALE TICKETS.** ## Swap Ticket or Trava\nUsers can swap Presale Ticket to Trava or Trava to Presale Ticket with the listing price of $1.2. The price will be converted to TRAVA price at the listing time.\nFor example, Alice wants to swap 1 Presale Ticket to TRAVA with the price of TRAVA at that time was $0,000415, and the listing price is fixed at $1.2\n=> Alice will receive ~2.891 TRAVA.\nWith the swapping Ticket or Trava mechanism, users can gain benefits by receiving larger profits than buying Ticket from Presale or Public Offering. Instead of owning a Ticket that has the price of $0.6 from Presale, the Ticket from swapping has a higher value and can be swapped with a larger amount of TRAVA. ## Provide Liquidity\nBesides swapping, there will also be a pool for TRAVA/Ticket. Users will have to provide Presale Tickets and TRAVA to receive TRAVA/Presale Ticket pair.\nWith this mechanism, liquidity providers can receive trading fees as rewards when the pool starts to facilitate trades.\n**‼️ NOTE:_THE LIQUIDITY POOL WILL BE LAUNCHED ON NOVEMBER 21, 2022!_**"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-of-trava-ticket-marketplace-5a04826eebf5?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----37-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.08391608391608392 }, { ""content"": ""##\n**Does Trava apply NFTs in the ecosystem?**\nYes, TRAVA allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract. ##\n**How does Trava price NFTs?**\nTrava will provide the auction function for NFT assets. Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way. We also avoid the price fluctuation of NFT because the NFTs have been priced in the auction contract before. ##\n**What can I do with NFTs after the auction?**\nTRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT.\nMeanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.\nPreviousTrava Credit ScoreNextListing\nLast updated 2 years ago\nWas this helpful?"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/faq/nfts"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""# Introduction To veTRAVA Marketplace\nPublished in\n3 min readFeb 9, 2023\nShare\nIntroduction to veTRAVA Marketplace\n _Along with the launch of Trava Governance, veTRAVA Marketplace brings Trava Finance to the next level of “Decentralized” by enabling peer-to-peer exchanging voting power, fostering the decision-making power of the whole ecosystem._ # What Is veTRAVA And Its Benefits?\n ## What is veTRAVA?\nTo fulfill the “decentralized” part of the Trava Decentralized Marketplace, we launched Trava Governance, based on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model, to give users decision-making power. In this case, veTRAVA, in the form of NFT, represents this power and is determined by the time and amount of locked tokens (as they show your commitment toward the future of Trava Finance).\nWith the implementation of the Trava Governance Vault, users can lock their TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB into this vault to receive a certain amount of veTRAVA representing their powers: the more veTRAVA you own, the higher your voting power in the Trava ecosystem. ## The Benefits Of Owning veTRAVA\nThe key value of veTRAVA is its representative of users’ power and their commitment to the project. As a result, in the long term, users who own veTRAVA can receive significant benefits:\n * Deciding on crucial parameters such as LTV, risk parameters, etc., in the lending pools (Trava Lending Pool and Users-owned Pools).\n * Receiving share profit coming from the fee charged by borrowers\n * Receiving boosting rewards **in rTRAVA** by providing liquidity and holding veTRAVA at the same time.\n * Earning TRAVA reward: the APR will be revealed soon.\n\n\nAs mentioned, veTRAVA is utilized as a form of NFT. For now, it can only be available for those who lock their token into the Governance Vault. However, it will be exchanged peer-to-peer with the launch of veTRAVA Marketplace. # veTRAVA Marketplace: Overview\nAs its name suggests, the veTRAVA marketplace is for users to buy and sell their veTRAVA. It means they can freely exchange their voting power. The main reason we came up with this idea is to optimize users’ experience, bringing them as much freedom as possible. It’s the “Decentralization” we are heading for.\nBesides bringing more freedom to users, veTRAVA Marketplace increases liquidity for veTRAVA and thus benefits both sellers and buyers. In more detail, buyers can buy veTRAVA (voting power) easily on Marketplace and then earn voting power immediately. In this case, the remaining locking time will be more flexible, no longer limited to a particular period set in the Governance Vault. When it comes to sellers, they can easily utilize crypto assets in a more liberal way and get benefits from it. ## The Influences of veTRAVA Marketplace\nveTRAVA Marketplace is an important feature that contributes to the development of Trava Governance.

At this transit point, you can combine all DeFi actions in just one transaction, reducing time and fees compared to making multiple transactions on different platforms.\nThe ultimate goal of Trava Station is to enhance user performance. I think this is a very good feature for our users.

Moreover, unlike other aggregators, BRicher lets investors own their tokens so that they can take complete control of capital and investment plans._\n \nThe first version of BRicher\nIn the first version, BRicher provided users with effective investment strategies with high returns and helped them keep track of their diaries (ROI and other critical parameters).\n_An investment strategy suggested by BRicher_\nHowever, the problem is that after discovering their best investment suggestion, users need to implement all the investing processes by themself, which is significantly time-consuming. Additionally, some “newbies” unfamiliar with various DApps may find it challenging to accomplish complicated operations independently.\nTo address these problems and provide users with more optimized options, we would like to offer new functions: Auto Investing and Semi-auto Investing.\nAs their name — “Auto”- these two new functions will automatically simplify the investment process and save investors much time.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n** _What is the Semi-auto Investing function?_**\n_Semi-auto Investing is a new feature that allows users to finish different stages of the investment strategies directly on the BRicher interface rather than on other DApps._\nIn more detail, recommended strategies usually consist of several steps, each with smaller operations. Performing all of these tasks in multiple DApps can be challenging and time-consuming.\nIn this case, the Semi-auto Investing function supports users effectively by allowing them to gradually execute the strategies on only one site — BRicher. That means even though users still need to invest step by step, there will be one button for each stage on BRicher’s interface for them to click on and complete the process easier.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n**_What benefit does it bring to users?_**\n  * It is much more convenient than the Manual Investing feature, which requires users to access each DApps and execute the required steps.\n  * Investors can control and keep track of each step of the investment implementation. That helps them to deeply understand the progress and, more importantly, make the modification in each step (cancel, for example) if necessary.\n\n\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What is the Auto Investing function?_**\nUpgraded from Semi-auto Investing, the Auto investing function requires users nothing but to click one only button. By doing that, the user authorizes BRicher to fully automate every phase of the investing strategy.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What benefits does it bring to users?_**\n  * The implementation of investment plans is made simpler by condensing complicated multi-step procedures into a single button.\n  * Compared to Manual investing and Semi-auto Investing, this function saves considerable time and effort for users.\n\n\n \nThe fundamental difference between these two functions\nFor a better understanding of the essential difference between Auto investing and Semi-auto Investing, let us take an example:\nAssuming that BRicher suggests users implement an investment plan that includes two main steps:\n  * Swap their tokens to TRAVA on PancakeSwap\n  * Stake TRAVA on the Trava governance vault to earn rewards and voting power.\n\n\nWith the Semi-auto Investing function, there will be two execute buttons corresponding two steps mentioned. In this case, investors can finish the investment process simply by clicking on these two buttons.\nWith the Auto investing function, the progress is even more optimized when they only need to click on one button.\n_Notes that: Unlike other Aggregators, Bricher does not hold investors’ tokens. In fact, they only authorize (approve) tokens, not transfer tokens to Bricher. Thus your tokens will always be yours._"",

,What is Smart Wallet and its purpose?,"In Trava Finance, the Smart Wallet is a specialized on-chain wallet system designed to automate, optimize, and secure user interactions with Trava’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It plays a key role in powering BRicher strategies, auto-investing, and portfolio management.

🧠 What Is the Smart Wallet in Trava?

The Smart Wallet is a smart contract-based wallet created and managed by Trava Finance on behalf of users when they interact with automated features like:
	•	✅ BRicher investment strategies
	•	✅ Auto-invest and semi-auto strategies
	•	✅ Optimized lending/borrowing allocation

Unlike MetaMask or traditional wallets, the Smart Wallet is:

Feature	Description
🔒 Non-custodial	Controlled by the user, but managed through smart contracts
🔄 Automated	Executes rebalancing, staking, and reward claiming without manual effort
🧩 Integrated	Works with all of Trava’s products—lending, staking, governance, etc.
🧠 Strategy-aware	Executes decisions based on BRicher’s optimization logic


⸻

🎯 Purpose of the Smart Wallet

Use Case	Benefit
💼 Investment execution	Automatically manages and allocates your assets according to the chosen strategy
🔁 Rebalancing	Moves funds between pools to maintain optimal APY/yield
🎁 Claiming rewards	Auto-claims and reinvests or holds tokens on your behalf
🛡️ Risk management	Ensures investments remain within healthy risk thresholds
📊 Centralized tracking	Allows easy monitoring of all strategy activities in your Portfolio view


⸻

🔧 How It Works
	•	When you start an auto- or semi-auto investment, a Smart Wallet is deployed specifically for your wallet address
	•	This Smart Wallet interacts with Trava protocols as your proxy, executing strategies, deposits, claims, and more
	•	You always retain ownership and control via your original connected wallet

⸻

Would you like to simulate how much a Smart Wallet could optimize returns for a given asset (e.g. TRAVA or BUSD)?","In Trava Finance, the Smart Wallet is a specialized wallet system that acts as a proxy or intermediary between the user and various Trava protocol features. It’s designed to enable advanced DeFi actions, multi-operation security, and credit behavior tracking — all without requiring separate transactions from your main wallet.

⸻

🧠 What is the Smart Wallet?

A Smart Wallet is an on-chain smart contract wallet created for your address when you interact with Trava’s Lending, NFT, or Credit Score modules.
It is non-custodial, meaning you retain full control — but Trava uses it to:
	•	Track your activity for credit scoring
	•	Manage assets (deposits, loans, staking) efficiently
	•	Securely separate user logic from protocol logic

⸻

🎯 Purpose of the Smart Wallet

Feature	Purpose
🧠 Credit Score Tracking	Smart Wallets track all on-chain lending/borrowing activity to compute your credit score
🔐 Security Layer	Adds abstraction between user wallet and protocol; reduces exploit risk
🔄 Efficient Execution	Allows batching actions (e.g., deposit + borrow + stake in one flow)
🧾 Data Indexing	Enables detailed reporting of wallet health, collateral ratio, etc.
💼 Governance & NFT Linking	Smart Wallet holds NFTs or veTRAVA for voting and staking use cases


⸻

⚙️ How It Works
	1.	You connect your MetaMask wallet to Trava.
	2.	When you interact with a lending pool, the system automatically deploys a Smart Wallet linked to your address.
	3.	All your deposits, borrows, and credit-related actions are routed through this Smart Wallet.
	4.	You can still fully control, view, and revoke access at any time.

⸻

📌 Summary

Component	Role
🔒 Non-custodial	You hold all keys — Smart Wallets are smart contracts you control
🧠 Credit foundation	All scoring logic comes from activity via this wallet
🧩 Modular support	Enables integration across Trava Lending, Tramlines, NFT, BRicher

""content"": ""To support the main features of Trava Station, we utilize Smart Wallet, which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. Conditions and access permissions are encoded into these self-executing code, rendering it both secure and adaptable for managing financial resources. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create a Smart Wallet, which will hold your assets during the operations.
With Trava Station, it now acts as an intermediary so that the requests of the users can be calculated and fulfilled in one go, making the experience much smoother. In addition, our Smart Wallet can serve as a stay point of your assets when you perform some special actions in the Trava ecosystem. For example, when you create an action with Freight in Trava Station to sell Armoury items, the money won’t immediately go into your Smart Wallet. The NFT will stay there until someone buys it on the Marketplace, at which point the process ends and now your Smart Wallet will hold the money from that sale.
Smart Wallet marks a pivotal juncture in our journey, offering heightened security and streamlined accessibility for Trava Station. For more information, you can check out our previous article on this Topic.

With Trava Station, it now acts as an intermediary so that the requests of the users can be calculated and fulfilled in one go, making the experience much smoother. In addition, our Smart Wallet can serve as a stay point of your assets when you perform some special actions in the Trava ecosystem. For example, when you create an action with Freight in Trava Station to sell Armoury items, the money won’t immediately go into your Smart Wallet. The NFT will stay there until someone buys it on the Marketplace, at which point the process ends and now your Smart Wallet will hold the money from that sale.

,How much should I keep my health factor at to avoid liquidation penalty?,"To avoid liquidation penalties on Trava Finance, you should keep your Health Factor (HF) safely above 1.0, ideally at or above 1.5.

⸻

⚠️ What Is Health Factor?
	•	The Health Factor is a numeric indicator of how safe your borrowed position is relative to your collateral.
	•	Formula:
\text{Health Factor} = \frac{\text{Collateral Value} \times \text{Liquidation Threshold}}{\text{Borrowed Value}}

⸻

✅ Recommended Health Factor Ranges

Health Factor	Status	Risk Level	Action
> 1.5	Safe	Low	👍 No action needed
1.1 – 1.5	Warning zone	Medium	⚠️ Consider repaying or adding collateral
≤ 1.0	Liquidation risk	High	❌ Can be liquidated anytime


⸻

🛡️ How to Stay Safe

To keep your Health Factor strong, you can:
	•	✅ Add more collateral
	•	✅ Repay part of your loan
	•	✅ Avoid borrowing volatile assets
	•	✅ Track price changes and HF regularly in the Portfolio

⸻

🔁 Example
	•	You deposited $1,000 in BUSD (collateral)
	•	Borrowed $500 in USDT
	•	Liquidation threshold = 85%
	•	HF = \frac{1000 × 0.85}{500} = 1.7 → SAFE

⸻

Would you like a custom calculation or simulation based on your actual borrow/collateral values to estimate how much you can safely borrow?","To avoid liquidation penalties on Trava Finance, you should keep your Health Factor (HF) well above 1.00, ideally at ≥ 1.5 or higher to stay safe during market volatility.

⸻

🧮 What Is the Health Factor?

The Health Factor is a metric that shows how safe your borrowed position is compared to your collateral value.

Formula:
Health Factor = (Collateral Value × Liquidation Threshold) / Borrowed Value

	•	If HF < 1.00 → you can be liquidated
	•	If HF = 1.00 → on the edge
	•	If HF > 1.00 → you’re safe
(the higher, the safer)

⸻

✅ Recommended Health Factor Levels

Health Factor Range	Status	Recommendation
⚠️ Below 1.00	Liquidation possible	Add collateral or repay immediately
😬 1.00 – 1.20	Very risky	Repay or boost collateral soon
😐 1.20 – 1.50	Moderate risk	Monitor frequently
✅ 1.50 – 2.00+	Safe zone	Low risk of liquidation
💹 2.00+	Very safe (low leverage)	Ideal for long-term positions


⸻

📌 How to Maintain a Safe Health Factor
	•	🏦 Add more collateral to increase HF
	•	💸 Repay some of your debt to reduce risk
	•	🔍 Monitor price fluctuations of your collateral/borrowed assets
	•	📈 Use stablecoins as collateral if you prefer less volatility

⸻

💥 What Happens If You’re Liquidated?
	•	A portion of your collateral is sold to cover the debt
	•	You pay a liquidation penalty, usually ~5–10% of the liquidated amount
	•	Your credit score drops significantly on Trava’s Tramlines

,Can i repay my loan with a different asset?,"On Trava Finance, you cannot repay your loan with a different asset than the one you originally borrowed.

⸻

🔁 Loan Repayment Rule
	•	💰 You must repay with the exact same token that you borrowed.
For example:

	•	If you borrowed USDT, you must repay in USDT
	•	If you borrowed BUSD, repayment must be in BUSD

⸻

⚠️ Why This Rule Exists
	•	Trava’s lending pools are asset-specific
	•	Repayments go directly back to the pool from which the asset was borrowed
	•	Cross-asset repayment would require on-chain swap mechanics, which Trava does not currently support

⸻

✅ What You Can Do

If you only have a different token (e.g., BUSD instead of USDT), you should:
	1.	Use a DEX like PancakeSwap to swap your token to the correct one
	2.	Then, return to Trava Station and repay the loan

⸻

Would you like help simulating the swap needed to repay a specific loan or calculating how much you’d need with slippage and gas included?","No, you cannot repay your loan with a different asset on Trava Finance — you must repay your loan using the same asset you borrowed.

💰 Repayment Rules on Trava Finance

Rule	Description
🔁 Same asset required	If you borrowed USDT, you must repay in USDT (not BUSD, TRAVA, etc.)
🔗 ERC-20 tokens only	Repayments must match the token contract used during borrowing
⛓️ On the same chain	Repayment must happen on the same blockchain network (e.g., BNB Chain)


⸻

🔄 How to Repay
	1.	Go to: https://app.trava.finance
	2.	Navigate to “Portfolio → Loans”
	3.	Find your borrowed position
	4.	Click “Repay” next to it
	5.	Ensure you have the exact borrowed token in your wallet
	6.	Approve (if first time), then confirm repayment

⸻

🚫 What Happens If You Try a Different Token?
	•	The repayment will fail
	•	The protocol doesn’t auto-convert tokens (no swap integration by default)
	•	You’ll need to use a DEX (like PancakeSwap) to swap to the correct token first

⸻

✅ Tip:

Use Trava’s Portfolio dashboard to check the exact amount and asset required for repayment to avoid confusion or failed transactions.

They are non-fungible, which naturally means that they are illiquid. Bringing liquidity to the NFT space would unlock a myriad of possibilities. As of May 2021, there have been no lending projects that make use of NFT as collaterals, because unlike a fungible currency or common stock, NFT value is difficult to determine. TRAVA.FINANCE adds more flexibility to the illiquid world of NFT and allows NFT owners to earn an ROI without selling it.\nTRAVA.FINANCE offers an innovative feature that prices NFTs based on auctions. After the auction, borrowers can use their NFTs as collateral. TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT. Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.\nThe auction process is as follows:\n 1. The NFT owner opens an auction session; she sets (i) the legal crypto used in the auction, (ii) the initial price for her NFT, (iii) the countdown time for the auction session, (iv) the mode for her auction (i.e., _auction-to-sell or auction-for-buy-right_), and other auction terms.\n 2. TRAVA.FINANCE users, who are interested in the NFT, can join in the auction session. To encourage users to participate in auctions, at the end of the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE randomly selects several bidders and rewards them with TRAVA tokens extracted from the auction fees. To guarantee that the bidders make their payment when they win the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE locks a number of their TRAVA tokens as soon as they join in the auction session and make a bid. When the auction finishes, they will immediately get their tokens back if they are not the winner. In case they are the winners, they can get their tokens back only if they pay for the auctioning NFT before the deadline.\n 3. In the _auction-to-sell_ mode, the auction winner will pay the owner the whole auction price to get the NFT.\n 4. In the _auction-for-buy-right_ mode, the auction winners have to pay a part of the auction price. We name the quotient of the amount the winners have to pay over the auction price \""_auction-paid ratio_ ”. The auction-paid ratio is calculated from the creditworthiness of the lender, borrower, NFT, and the auction terms. The NFT owners can use the cryptos paid by the auction winner as collateral for their loans. Once they repay their loan including the interest to the auction winners, they can get the NFT back. Otherwise, they will lose their NFT to the auction winners. These rules are all defined in the auction smart contract.\n\n\nTRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below.\n * **NFT owners** can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it. TRAVA.FINANCE thus increases the liquidity of NFTs and opens up a unique and exciting NFTFi marketplace.\n * Based on the given number of auction bids, **bidders** have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session. This rewarding mechanism provides incentives for users to actively make a bid in the auction.\n * **Auction winners** can get their desired NFT at a price lower than their bidding price (once NFT owners cannot repay the loan) or they can receive considerable interest from their loan to NFT owners (once NFT owners repay the loans and get their NFT back).\n * The credit scores of **NFT owners, auction winners, bidders,** and **NFTs** can be improved after auctions.\n\n\nThe auction mechanism for NFT can also be applied to any type of digital asset.

Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner.\nTRAVA.FINANCE uses credit scores to ensure the safety of the lending process. Pool owners and lenders can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. Based on the credit scores, they can determine the maximum Loan-To-Value ratio for borrowers. Borrowers with high credit scores get preferential treatment; they can borrow cryptos with more favorable interest rates and Loan-To-Value ratios. Credit scores provide an incentive for users to (i) hold their wallet addresses as long as possible and keep them clean, (ii) perform the cross-chain identification protocol to interlink their addresses, (iii) perform more transactions inside and outside TRAVA.FINANCE, and so on. This increases crypto liquidity and fosters the growth of the DeFi system.\nThe credit score evaluation in TRAVA.FINANCE is primarily based on on-chain data. At present, we collect, enrich, and analyze Binance Smart Chain transactions, including the native transferring transactions and the transactions to deposit, withdraw, repay, and borrow tokens generated from Binance Smart Chain lending DApps.\nTRAVA.FINANCE evaluates credit scores for both wallet addresses and other digital assets. Wallet addresses operated for a long time with good transaction history (e.g., an address that has transactions with many other addresses, always pays debts on time, and performs transactions frequently) will have a high credit score. Pool owners can use credit scores as a criterion to select competent wallet addresses for their pool’s liquidity providers.\nThe credit rating of digital assets helps pool owners and liquid providers to minimize liquidity risk. TRAVA.FINANCE divides digital assets into two categories: Tokens/coins and other digital assets (e.g., NFT, smart contracts, stoke tokens) and evaluates their credit scores. The credit score of a **Token** is assessed based on 4 parameters, i.e., (i) the token price, (ii) the market cap (MC) of the token, (iii) the token trading volume, and (iv) the number of transactions related to the token. High-credit-score tokens have a great advantage over low-credit-score tokens. Once being used as collaterals, they offer high loan-to-value ratios to borrowers; lenders also get favorable lending interest rates with their high-credit-score tokens. Users can improve their credit scores once they possess those high-valuable digital assets.\nTRAVA.FINANCE also performs credit ratings for other **digital assets such as NFT**. The credit scores for NFTs are estimated based on the number of times that they have been auctioned on TRAVA.FINANCE or other trusted platforms. NFTs’ scores should not depend on their price because their price is typically determined in an unreliable manner, based on the emotion and the preference of customers.\nTo evaluate credit scores for a wallet address, TRAVA.FINANCE credit scoring model will take into account the following factors:\n * _Total asset_. The total asset represents the financial strength of the wallet address; it is the most intuitive and easiest-to-evaluate parameter. It is also the second most important parameter that affects credit scores. The total asset is the sum of balance and total investment minus total liabilities. The credit score of the address is proportional to its total asset. As this parameter is a volatility index, the credit score is calculated based on both the _average total asset_ in a certain period and the _total current asset_.\n * _Transaction history_. Transaction history is the most important parameter; it has a major impact on credit scores. TRAVA.FINANCE collects and aggregates all exchanges, loans, deposits, and other transactions of the wallet address across multiple DApps to calculate various intermediate parameters such as (i) the age of the address, (ii) its transaction amount, (iii) its frequency of transaction, (iv) its number of liquidations and (v) its total value of liquidations.\n * _Loan ratios_. Loan ratios (debt ratios) represent the debt position of the account. It is divided into two sub-parameters, i.e., loan-to-balance ratio and loan-to-investment ratio.\n * _Circulating assets_. This parameter represents how active users are in the crypto market. The more money they invest in the crypto market, the more creditworthiness they gain from others. This parameter is evaluated based on 2 sub-parameters, (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE (Return on equity).\n * _Trustworthiness of possessing assets_. The last parameter for credit rating is the trustworthiness of the assets owned by the wallet address. The wallet can improve its credit score by possessing high-value and trustworthy digital assets.

	•	The TRAVA token follows a vesting schedule that gradually distributes tokens over time to:
	•	The team
	•	Investors
	•	Community incentives
	•	Ecosystem and development funds
	•	The final vesting period ends in September 2025, at which point:
	•	All allocated TRAVA tokens will be unlocked
	•	No additional token inflation is expected beyond this point

⸻

📌 Why It Matters

Impact Area	What Happens After Full Release
🛡️ Market Supply	Total token supply becomes fixed (more predictable market dynamics)
🎯 Incentives	Reward pools will rely on circulating tokens, not new emissions
🗳️ Governance	All veTRAVA-based voting will reflect fully vested token power


⸻

Would you like a breakdown of the TRAVA token allocation (e.g., how much went to team, community, investors)?","The full release of the TRAVA token follows a vesting and distribution schedule as outlined in Trava Finance’s tokenomics. While there is no single “unlock date” for the entire supply, here’s a breakdown of what is known:

⸻

📅 TRAVA Token Release Schedule (Overview)

Allocation Category	Release Method	Vesting/Unlock Period
🪙 Public Sale	Immediate / short vesting	Mostly released
🧑‍💻 Team & Advisors	Locked, then linear vesting	~6–24 months vesting after cliff
📈 Liquidity Mining	Distributed via user rewards	Ongoing
🎁 Community & Marketing	Released for growth initiatives	Periodic unlocks
🏦 Reserve & Treasury	Controlled by governance/milestones	Gradual, as per DAO vote


⸻

🔐 When Is It Fully Released?

The entire token supply is not released all at once. Most long-term allocations (like team and reserve) are fully unlocked over 2–4 years, following this logic:

⏳ Estimated full release window: Q4 2023 – Q4 2025, depending on category.

You can check:

,Explain in details Trava governace v1 and the vision for version 2,"Trava Governance is the decentralized decision-making system that allows the Trava Finance community to propose, discuss, and vote on protocol changes. It operates in two major phases:

⸻

🏛️ Trava Governance v1 – Current Model

✅ Key Components
	1.	veTRAVA Token
	•	Voting power is based on veTRAVA, which users receive by locking TRAVA tokens.
	•	Longer lock durations = more voting power.
	2.	Governance Forum
	•	Community members can create and discuss proposals.
	•	Proposals are categorized by topics like lending, BRicher, NFT, ecosystem, etc.
	3.	Snapshot Voting
	•	Voting occurs on Snapshot.org, an off-chain platform.
	•	No gas fees to vote.
	•	Weight of each vote depends on the veTRAVA balance at a specific snapshot block.
	4.	Proposal Lifecycle
	•	Discussion → Proposal Submission → Snapshot Voting → Execution (off-chain or manual)
	5.	Security Advisory Board (SAB)
	•	A group of technical experts to review sensitive proposals.
	•	Can intervene in emergencies for protocol safety.

⸻

🔒 Limitations in Governance v1
	•	Proposals are non-binding (votes must be manually enforced)
	•	Requires external tools (Snapshot + forum)
	•	Does not fully reflect on-chain execution and automation
	•	Lacks incentive alignment for long-term veTRAVA holders beyond voting

⸻

🚀 Trava Governance v2 – Vision & Future Enhancements

Trava Governance v2 aims to introduce fully on-chain, trustless governance with broader participation, automation, and economic alignment.

🔮 Vision Highlights

Area	Governance v2 Feature
🔗 Fully On-chain Voting	All proposals and execution will be on-chain (no Snapshot dependency)
🛠️ DAO Module Integration	Direct connection to protocol logic for auto-execution of passed proposals
🎯 Quadratic or Delegated Voting	Fairer representation by reducing whale influence or allowing trusted delegate voting
🧠 Reputation-based Weighting	Voting power may combine veTRAVA with credit score, participation history, etc.
🎁 Incentivized Governance	Active voters and proposal creators may earn rewards (from treasury or protocol income)
🔄 Proposal Templates and Automation	Easier for users to create structured proposals (e.g., change interest rate, launch new pool)
🧩 Ecosystem-wide Governance	One DAO to govern multiple Trava products: Lending Pools, BRicher, NFT Market, etc.


⸻

🧱 Core Goals of Governance v2
	•	📈 Scalability: Allow more users to participate easily
	•	⚖️ Transparency: All actions verifiable and trustless
	•	🤝 Decentralization: Less reliance on core team for execution
	•	💡 Community-driven: Encourage innovation from users and partners

⸻

🧠 Summary

Feature	Governance v1	Governance v2 (Vision)
Voting	Off-chain (Snapshot)	Fully on-chain
Execution	Manual	Automated smart contracts
Power Basis	veTRAVA only	veTRAVA + credit + history
Incentives	None	Rewards for voters/creators
Product Scope	Limited (main protocol)	Ecosystem-wide (multi-pool, NFT)

⸻

🧑‍⚖️ Trava Governance v1: The Foundation Layer

Trava Governance v1 is the initial version of the decentralized governance system launched to empower the community to influence decisions in the Trava ecosystem.

✅ Key Features of Governance v1

Component	Description
🗳️ veTRAVA voting power	Users lock TRAVA to mint veTRAVA, which gives them voting rights
📄 Snapshot voting	Governance proposals are voted on via off-chain voting (Snapshot.org)
🎯 4 Governance Modules	1. Proposal system 2. Voting system 3. Execution logic 4. Security Advisory Board (SAB)
⛑️ Security Advisory Board (SAB)	Protects the protocol by vetoing malicious or exploitative proposals
🧩 Forum discussions	Community starts discussions via the Trava Forum before voting
🗓 Voting Periods	Fixed voting durations (e.g., 3–7 days), depending on proposal tier

🎯 What You Can Vote On in v1
	•	Launch of new lending pools
	•	Fee adjustments
	•	veTRAVA reward distribution
	•	Treasury allocations
	•	Protocol parameter changes (e.g., LTV, interest rates)

🚀 Vision for Trava Governance v2: Full DAO Autonomy

Governance v2 is being designed to upgrade Trava Finance into a fully autonomous, modular DAO, increasing decentralization, flexibility, and developer collaboration.

🌐 Goals of Governance v2

Vision Element	Description
🔗 On-chain Governance	Move from Snapshot (off-chain) to fully on-chain execution
🧠 Intelligent DAO	Integrate Tramlines credit data to weight votes based on wallet behavior or creditworthiness
🧰 Modular DAO Tools	Enable custom governance modules for sub-communities or pool creators
🗃 Decentralized Treasury	Treasury becomes community-controlled with advanced budgeting mechanisms
🧩 Proposal Templates	Built-in smart contract templates for new pool creation, veTRAVA changes, or staking events
📊 Reputation Scoring	Combine veTRAVA + EXP + credit score to give reputation-based voting weight (not just capital)


⸻

🔄 From v1 to v2: Evolution Path

Feature	Governance v1	Governance v2 (Vision)
Voting System	Snapshot (off-chain)	Fully on-chain smart contracts
Voting Power	Based on veTRAVA only	veTRAVA + EXP + user credit history (weighted)
Proposal Access	Limited to high veTRAVA holders	Open tiers based on EXP & participation
Treasury Control	Partial (team-controlled)	Community multisig/DAO full control
Pool Creation	Admin-led	DAO-led using proposal templates

For version 1 of Trava Governance, we present evolution in governance processes with on-chain features enabled.
Governance Process

The governance process consists of 2 continuous processes: off-chain & on-chain.

    Off-chain process:

In the off-chain process, anyone in the Trava community can raise their opinions and discuss ideas of how the protocol can improve by creating TRC - Trava Request for Comments on the Trava Forum.

After an idea is well-formed, a community member can follow our template for TIP - Trava Improvement Proposal and post on the forum for details feedback. We recommend off-chain voting (powered by snapshot.org) to gain exposure and rough consensus from the community to increase the chance of succeeding in the on-chain process.

When a TIP gets to its final version, the DAO Committee is in charge of the review process and officially proposes on-chain.

    On-chain process:

When a TIP is proposed on-chain, it becomes transparent on the public blockchain; anyone possessing voting power can directly vote for or against this proposal.

After the voting period, a TIP will be queued and executed by the public.

The Security Advisory Board acts as a guardian to prevent malicious actions and security exploits in this process.
Governance Authority

In governance version 1, the DAO will have authority over the Trava lending protocol. The community will have to agree on any significant changes or updates through the on-chain process.
Governance Power

To gain governance power, holders need to lock their Trava or rTrava token in exchange for the veTRAVA token, which holds voting power. This vote locking mechanism encourages users who show a solid commitment to the protocol with more governance power and incentive.""

""content"": ""In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol.
Trava Governance Version 1

In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc.

In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including:

    Discussion: In this stage, Trava holders will discuss different problems on the Trava Forum.
    Proposal: On this forum, once a person brings his or her ideas to the platform, the community will determine whether they should be considered by up-voting this proposal. If the community approves, it will be brought on the snapshot in the next step.
    Voting off-chain on the snapshot: On the snapshot, users will vote for the proposition they want.
    Voting on-chain: After the voting on the snapshot, the whole governance process will then be generated totally on-chain.
    Execution: After the stage of making the decision, there are two scenarios. If the proposal is accepted, it will be executed; otherwise, it will be canceled.

In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: the amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time.

Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features:

    Democracy: The voting enforcement process is democratic and transparent.
    Connectivity: The community members can recommend, discuss, and manage the products and the development direction of the Trava Ecosystem.
    Up-to-date: The community members can recommend the latest technologies and features based on the market trend that help the whole system make changes to the protocol for the best result.

The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2

Trava is the first one that allows users to create and manage their own lending pool. In the future, governance will play a significant role in the initialization movements and their operation in the future.

In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process.

Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.""

After more than seven months of launching the Trava Lending pool, it is now deployed on three chains (BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Fantom), and supports above 15 assets._\n_Based on this stepstone, we plan to enrich the utilities continuously in 2 main directions:_**_Trava Governance_** _and_** _NFT-Collateralization_** _for the lending pool._\n \n**_The long-term vision with Trava Governance_**\nWith Trava Governance, we provide our users with decision-making power. By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project.\nIn addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated.\nIn the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol.\n \n**_Trava Governance Version 1_**\nIn version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc.\n_In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including:_\n  1. **_Discussion:_** In this stage, Trava holders will discuss different problems on the Trava Forum.\n  2. **_Proposal:_** On this forum, once a person brings his or her ideas to the platform, the community will determine whether they should be considered by up-voting this proposal. If the community approves, it will be brought on the snapshot in the next step.\n  3. **_Voting off-chain on the snapshot:_** On the snapshot, users will vote for the proposition they want.\n  4. **_Voting on-chain:_** After the voting on the snapshot, the whole governance process will then be generated totally on-chain.\n  5. **_Execution:_** After the stage of making the decision, there are two scenarios. If the proposal is accepted, it will be executed; otherwise, it will be canceled.\n\n\nIn this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: the amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time.\nImplement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features:\n  * **_Democracy_** : The voting enforcement process is democratic and transparent.\n  * **_Connectivity_** : The community members can recommend, discuss, and manage the products and the development direction of the Trava Ecosystem.\n  * **_Up-to-date_** : The community members can recommend the latest technologies and features based on the market trend that help the whole system make changes to the protocol for the best result.\n\n\n \nThe Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2\nTrava is the first one that allows users to create and manage their own lending pool. In the future, governance will play a significant role in the initialization movements and their operation in the future.\nIn version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in **Quarter 3 this year**. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process.\nUsers who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.\nFollow Trava’s channels to get the latest updates:\nWebsite | | | | Blog | | \n \nThe Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2\nTrava is the first one that allows users to create and manage their own lending pool.

Governance Process  The governance process consists of 2 continuous processes: off-chain & on-chain.      Off-chain process:  In the off-chain process, anyone in the Trava community can raise their opinions and discuss ideas of how the protocol can improve by creating TRC - Trava Request for Comments on the Trava Forum.  After an idea is well-formed, a community member can follow our template for TIP - Trava Improvement Proposal and post on the forum for details feedback. We recommend off-chain voting (powered by snapshot.org) to gain exposure and rough consensus from the community to increase the chance of succeeding in the on-chain process.  When a TIP gets to its final version, the DAO Committee is in charge of the review process and officially proposes on-chain.      On-chain process:  When a TIP is proposed on-chain, it becomes transparent on the public blockchain; anyone possessing voting power can directly vote for or against this proposal.  After the voting period, a TIP will be queued and executed by the public.  The Security Advisory Board acts as a guardian to prevent malicious actions and security exploits in this process. Governance Authority  In governance version 1, the DAO will have authority over the Trava lending protocol. The community will have to agree on any significant changes or updates through the on-chain process. Governance Power  To gain governance power, holders need to lock their Trava or rTrava token in exchange for the veTRAVA token, which holds voting power. This vote locking mechanism encourages users who show a solid commitment to the protocol with more governance power and incentive.', 'In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol.

Execution: After the stage of making the decision, there are two scenarios. If the proposal is accepted, it will be executed; otherwise, it will be canceled.  In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: the amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time.  Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features:      Democracy: The voting enforcement process is democratic and transparent.     Connectivity: The community members can recommend, discuss, and manage the products and the development direction of the Trava Ecosystem.     Up-to-date: The community members can recommend the latest technologies and features based on the market trend that help the whole system make changes to the protocol for the best result.

""content"": ""What is veTRAVA?

To fulfill the “decentralized” part of the Trava Decentralized Marketplace, we launched Trava Governance, based on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model, to give users decision-making power. In this case, veTRAVA, in the form of NFT, represents this power and is determined by the time and amount of locked tokens (as they show your commitment toward the future of Trava Finance).

With the implementation of the Trava Governance Vault, users can lock their TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB into this vault to receive a certain amount of veTRAVA representing their powers: the more veTRAVA you own, the higher your voting power in the Trava ecosystem.
The Benefits Of Owning veTRAVA

The key value of veTRAVA is its representative of users’ power and their commitment to the project. As a result, in the long term, users who own veTRAVA can receive significant benefits:

    Deciding on crucial parameters such as LTV, risk parameters, etc., in the lending pools (Trava Lending Pool and Users-owned Pools).
    Receiving share profit coming from the fee charged by borrowers
    Receiving boosting rewards in rTRAVA by providing liquidity and holding veTRAVA at the same time.
    Earning TRAVA reward: the APR will be revealed soon.

As mentioned, veTRAVA is utilized as a form of NFT. For now, it can only be available for those who lock their token into the Governance Vault. However, it will be exchanged peer-to-peer with the launch of veTRAVA Marketplace.
veTRAVA Marketplace: Overview

As its name suggests, the veTRAVA marketplace is for users to buy and sell their veTRAVA. It means they can freely exchange their voting power. The main reason we came up with this idea is to optimize users’ experience, bringing them as much freedom as possible. It’s the “Decentralization” we are heading for.

Besides bringing more freedom to users, veTRAVA Marketplace increases liquidity for veTRAVA and thus benefits both sellers and buyers. In more detail, buyers can buy veTRAVA (voting power) easily on Marketplace and then earn voting power immediately. In this case, the remaining locking time will be more flexible, no longer limited to a particular period set in the Governance Vault. When it comes to sellers, they can easily utilize crypto assets in a more liberal way and get benefits from it.
The Influences of veTRAVA Marketplace

veTRAVA Marketplace is an important feature that contributes to the development of Trava Governance. As mentioned above, users who hold many veTRAVA will have a crucial role in the decision-making process of the Trava Finance ecosystem. The veTRAVA holders can alternate the voting results, and through the Marketplace, users can buy or sell the voting power with others.

With the fact that users can trade their voting power to each other, anyone in the ecosystem will have a chance to vote for the changes they want to make in Trava Finance. The more users have veTRAVA, the more voting power is distributed, and users will be given the full power to make the decisions that can affect the Decentralized Lending Marketplace, which will elevate the decentralized side of Trava Finance’s ultimate goal.""

      ""content"": ""**Does Trava apply NFTs in the ecosystem?**\nYes, TRAVA allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract.\n \n\n**How does Trava price NFTs?**\nTrava will provide the auction function for NFT assets. Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way. We also avoid the price fluctuation of NFT because the NFTs have been priced in the auction contract before.\n \n\n**What can I do with NFTs after the auction?**\nTRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT.\nMeanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.\nPreviousTrava Credit ScoreNextListing\nLast updated 2 years ago\nWas this helpful?"",

,What is health factor and how is it calculated exactly?,"In Trava Finance, the Health Factor (HF) is a crucial metric that indicates the safety of your borrowed position. It compares the value of your collateral to the value of your debt, helping you (and the protocol) assess how close you are to liquidation.

⸻

🧠 What Is the Health Factor?

The Health Factor tells you how well-collateralized your borrowing is:
	•	HF > 1.0 → SAFE (your collateral sufficiently covers your loan)
	•	HF ≤ 1.0 → AT RISK (your loan can be liquidated)

⸻

📊 Formula to Calculate Health Factor

\text{Health Factor} = \frac{\sum (\text{Collateral Value}_i \times \text{Liquidation Threshold}_i)}{\text{Total Borrowed Value}}

✅ Components:

Term	Description
Collateral Value	Total value (USD) of all supplied assets used as collateral
Liquidation Threshold	The % of collateral value considered safe before liquidation (e.g., 80%)
Borrowed Value	Total value (USD) of all borrowed assets


⸻

🔢 Example

Let’s say:
	•	You supplied $1,000 USDT as collateral
→ Liquidation threshold: 85%
	•	You borrowed $500 BUSD

Then:

\text{Health Factor} = \frac{1000 \times 0.85}{500} = \frac{850}{500} = 1.7

✅ Result: You’re in a safe zone (HF = 1.7)

⸻

🛡️ Recommended Safety Levels

Health Factor	Status	Risk Level
> 2.0	Very safe	🔵 Low
1.5–2.0	Safe	🟢 Low–Mid
1.1–1.5	Warning zone	🟠 Medium
≤ 1.0	Liquidation risk!	🔴 High


⸻

📌 Notes
	•	Each asset has its own liquidation threshold (e.g., volatile assets may be lower).
	•	You can improve your HF by:
	•	🔺 Adding more collateral
	•	🔻 Repaying part of your debt
	•	Check it live via your Trava Station Portfolio.

⸻

Would you like to simulate your health factor with specific values (e.g., “if I supply 2,000 USDT and borrow 1,200 BUSD”)?","In Trava Finance, the Health Factor is a crucial indicator that measures the safety of your borrowing position. It determines how close you are to liquidation based on the value of your collateral versus your debt.

⸻

🧮 What Is Health Factor?

The Health Factor (HF) is a risk ratio:

Health Factor = (Total Collateral Value × Liquidation Threshold) / Total Borrowed Value

	•	If HF > 1 → your loan is safe (you won’t be liquidated)
	•	If HF = 1 → you’re on the edge (risk of liquidation)
	•	If HF < 1 → liquidation can occur at any time

⸻

📊 Components of the Formula

Component	Meaning
🧱 Collateral Value	USD value of the assets you deposited
📉 Borrowed Value	USD value of the assets you borrowed (plus interest)
🧮 Liquidation Threshold	% of the collateral’s value that can be borrowed before liquidation

🔑 Liquidation Threshold depends on the asset
e.g. Stablecoin: 90%, Volatile asset: 60–70%

⸻

📘 Example Calculation

Let’s say you deposit:
	•	$10,000 USDT as collateral
	•	Liquidation Threshold for USDT is 90%

You borrow:
	•	$6,000 in BUSD

Then:

Health Factor = (10,000 × 0.9) / 6,000 = 9,000 / 6,000 = 1.5

✅ Safe — you’re not at risk of liquidation.

⸻

⚠️ Health Factor Thresholds

Health Factor	Risk Level	Action Recommended
🟥 < 1.00	Critical – Liquidatable	Add more collateral or repay immediately
🟧 1.00–1.20	High Risk	Monitor closely, top up collateral
🟨 1.20–1.50	Moderate	Acceptable, but watch asset volatility
🟩 > 1.50	Safe	Low risk, efficient use of capital


⸻

🔐 Why It Matters
	•	Prevents loss of collateral through liquidation
	•	Affects your Trava credit score on Tramlines
	•	Determines your borrowing capacity

""content"": ""What is Health factor?

Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds.
What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation?

The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals.""

Audit Scope

The audit focused on the following considerations:

    Testing the smart contracts against both common and uncommon attack vectors.

    Assessing the codebase to ensure compliance with current best practices and industry standards.

    Ensuring contract logic meets the specifications and intentions of the client.

    Cross-referencing contract structure and implementation against similar smart contracts produced by industry leaders.

    Thorough line-by-line manual review of the entire codebase by industry experts

Findings:

There are seven issues found in total, including 1 Minor Finding, 2 Informational Findings, and 4 Major Findings.

Firstly, one Minor and Two Informational Issues concern some coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused functions, missing zero addresses checking, and function type. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.

Secondly, all four Major Issues are related to Centralization. The owners of the following contracts below can execute some functions without obtaining the consensus of the community:

    FactoryRegistry,

    AddressesProviderFactory

    PoolUpdateControl

    LendingPoolConfigurator 

Certik Recommendations for the Centralization Issue:

Certik advised to carefully manage the governance/guardian account’s private key to avoid any potential risks of being hacked. In general, Certik strongly recommended centralized privileges or roles in the protocol to be improved via a decentralized mechanism or via smart-contract-based accounts with enhanced security practices, e.g. Multisignature wallets.

Some feasible solutions recommended by Certik that would also mitigate the potential risk include:

    Time-lock with reasonable latency, i.e. 48 hours, for awareness on privileged operations;

    Assignment of privileged roles to multi-signature wallets to prevent a single point of failure due to the private key;

    Introduction of a DAO/governance/voting module to increase transparency and user involvement.

Trava Solutions for the Centralization Issue

Trava has partially resolved these issues via smart-contract-based accounts. In particular:

    Deploy a Multi-Signature wallet in BSC mainnet at the address: 

0xdF73aC573Dfd430f4C5558B8CbeD86e86145501B

    Set up the owner of the contracts and governance to the multi-signature wallet.

Although these issues are major, our approach can avoid the potential risks of centralization. Moreover, in our roadmap, we will enable DAO Functionalities in Q2–2022. The introduction of the DAO module will completely resolve the centralization issues. This approach will make our community control the process and activity of Trava Finance in the near future.""

This thorough security audit checked and ensured the following imperative points as 2 main Categories (1) Code review (2) Functional.

The audit report contains all found security vulnerabilities and other issues in the reviewed code. As a result of the audit, There are no critical issues in our contracts. Besides, Hacken’s security engineers found 4 high, 4 medium, and 3 low severity issues. Overall, after the auditing process, Hacken evaluated Trava’s contracts as Well-Secured (the highest level of security as the assessment).
Severity High

There is one issue regarding the implementation function and three issues regarding uninitialized state variables:

    Issue 1 (unimplemented function): The logic of function finalizeTranfer has commented-out unimplemented logic. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.

    Issues 2, 3, 4 (uninitialized state variables): Some state variables are not initialized for the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager but they are being called.

        Trava’s Response: We consider the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager as a Logic Contract where we execute our code by using delegate call from LendingPool Contract. That explains why we don’t initialize the state for that variable.

        Following the verification, Hacken determined that these are not issues.

Severity Medium

There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused imports, Not checked contract address, and No event on lendingPoolConfigurator change. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.

There is one Issue concerning Possible FlashLoan attack in the LendingPool contract. Despite the fact that we do not believe this attack could happen in real life, we took great care in resolving the problem.

Description: IF both of TToken and its underlyingAsset are traded on multiple DEXes and have different rates there could be a FlashLoan attack. Attackers could FlashLoan a TToken, and process withdraw, which will give then the exact same amount of the underlyingAsset, and then calling deposit, they will receive the same amount of TToken.

Having the 1-to-1 “exchange” on the LendingPool and different rates on DEXes, attackers could “play” with the market many times in one transaction until they receive enough rewards. The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.

The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.

Hacken’s Recommendation: Consider some restrictions like minting/returning assets in the next block only.

Trava’s solution: Token transfer restrictions for transferring in the same block where minting occurred.

After the verification, Hacken concluded that the issue had been resolved completely.
Severity Low

There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to Unused state variable, public/external function, Unused function argument. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.""

maximum input length exceeded for answer,Explain EXP and how can I use it for Farming,"In Trava Finance, EXP is a special utility point system used to enhance your Farming rewards. It is not a token, but rather a non-transferable score that increases based on your activity within the Trava ecosystem — especially veTRAVA holding, staking, lending, and BRicher usage.

⸻

🧠 What Is EXP (Experience Point)?

Feature	Description
📈 EXP (Experience Points)	A personal score that reflects how actively you engage with Trava Finance
🔐 Non-transferable	EXP stays tied to your wallet; cannot be traded or withdrawn
🧮 Calculated dynamically	Based on your activity like locking TRAVA, borrowing/lending, etc.
🎯 Used in Farming	EXP affects your weight and reward multiplier in specific Farming pools


⸻

🌾 How EXP Is Used in Farming

In Trava Farming Pools, your reward share is influenced not only by your deposit amount, but also by your EXP score. More EXP = a bigger share of the rewards, even with the same deposit.

📊 Farming Boost Formula (Simplified):

\text{Effective Farming Power} = \text{Staked Amount} \times (1 + \text{EXP Bonus Factor})
	•	EXP works like a multiplier booster
	•	Users with higher EXP will farm more TRAVA or partner tokens

⸻

🛠️ How to Earn EXP

Action	EXP Gained?	Notes
🔒 Lock TRAVA into veTRAVA	✅ Yes	The more and longer, the higher EXP
💼 Stake into Farming pools	✅ Yes	Active stakers earn EXP over time
💸 Borrow/Lend on Lending Pool	✅ Yes	Higher volume = more EXP
🤖 Use BRicher strategies	✅ Yes	Auto/semi-auto modes reward EXP
🧪 Join other Trava programs	✅ Varies	E.g. Fortune Mining, NFT Auction, etc.


⸻

🎯 How to Use EXP for Farming
	1.	Go to: https://station.trava.finance
	2.	Navigate to Farming section
	3.	Choose a farming pool that supports EXP bonus
	4.	Stake your tokens (e.g., TRAVA, BUSD, veTRAVA)
	5.	Your effective power and APR will reflect your EXP level

⸻

📌 Example
	•	Two users each stake 1,000 TRAVA
	•	User A has EXP = 0 → Reward weight = 1,000
	•	User B has EXP bonus factor of +20% → Reward weight = 1,200
→ User B earns 20% more from the same deposit

⸻

Would you like to estimate how much EXP you’d need to reach a certain farming boost (e.g., 1.5× farming power)?","In Trava Finance, EXP (short for Experience Points) is a non-transferable gamified metric that represents your level of participation and activity across the Trava ecosystem. It is central to Trava’s gamification layer, especially in NFT evolution, Knight ranking, and reward-boosting mechanisms.

⸻

🌟 What is EXP in Trava Finance?

Feature	Description
🎮 Gamification Metric	EXP tracks your involvement in staking, governance, mining, etc.
🔐 Non-transferable	EXP cannot be traded, sold, or sent — it is tied to your wallet only
🏆 Used for Upgrades	Required for Knight NFT evolution, equipment crafting, and rank advancement
💹 Farming Multiplier	EXP can boost your farming efficiency or eligibility for exclusive reward pools


⸻

🔧 How to Earn EXP

Activity	EXP Gained
🪙 Staking TRAVA	In features like Dilution Staking, Fortune Mining
🗳️ veTRAVA Governance	Locking TRAVA into veTRAVA gives EXP
⚔️ Knight Battles	Winning fights or defending territory
🎁 Special Events	Seasonal EXP drops or loot-based challenges

💡 You can track your EXP on your Dashboard → Portfolio → EXP section

⸻

🌾 How to Use EXP for Farming

While EXP itself doesn’t yield tokens, it enhances your farming capabilities and reward tiers in several Trava modules:

✅ 1. Fortune Mining Boost
	•	Users with high EXP may unlock higher APR tiers or better lottery odds
	•	EXP may determine mining group assignments, with stronger groups earning more rewards

✅ 2. Knight-Based Farming
	•	EXP increases your Knight’s rank and abilities
	•	Higher-ranked Knights gain access to exclusive staking zones, boosting yield

✅ 3. Dilution Staking Access
	•	Some premium pools or limited-edition events may require a minimum EXP level to enter
	•	Pools may assign multiplier tiers based on EXP

⸻

🎯 Use Case Summary

Use Case	How EXP Is Used
🪖 NFT Evolution	Required to level up Knight NFTs
💥 Knight Battles	Affects power, ranking, and staking access
🎁 Special Farming Pools	Some pools only open to EXP holders
🚀 APR Multipliers	EXP can boost reward rates indirectly


⸻

🔍 Important Notes
	•	EXP is earned, not bought
	•	It is tied to your wallet (or your Smart Wallet on Trava)
	•	EXP decays very slowly only in some cases (e.g., inactivity or burn events)

""content"": ""At the moment, EXP (Experience Point) is the point that shows how long an Armoury NFT is staked in our vaults. EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault.

Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault

We’ve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items).

You can see your EXP  either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace.

Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs. However, when you withdraw your Knight NFT, disassemble and reassemble with different items to get another Knight NFT, your Armoury NFTs will have different EXPs.

For example: You open 4 chests and get: Helmet, Shield, Armour and Weapon. You assemble them into a Knight NFT and farm in our vault. After 24h, the EXPs for Armoury NFTs are as follow:

    Weapon EXP: 86400

    Shield EXP: 86400

    Armor EXP: 86400

    Helmet EXP: 86400

So EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow:
(86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400
(86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400

After 24h, you withdraw your Knight NFT to reassemble with Armoury NFTs you buy on Trava NFT Marketplace. Suppose, those Armoury NFTs you bought have been already farmed in vault before and have the EXPs as follow:

    Weapon EXP: 86400

    Shield EXP: 100000

    Armor EXP: 320000

    Helmet EXP: 210000

Thus, the EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow:
(86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100
(86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100

There will be a lot of benefits for NFT owners to have high EXPs. The more EXP you have, the more value the NFT will be. This can help you to distinguish NFT value from other NFTs of the same type and rarity. Moreover, the EXP will be applied in our Trade-up Mechanism which will be launched soon. In the future, EXP will be used with Credit Score and applied to NFT-collateralization. It can be said that EXP is an important factor in Trava Knight NFT to reach our goal of collateralization.""

""content"": ""Heuristic Farming (Farming based on EXP)

When the new Farming mechanism commences, our 5 current Farming vaults will stop distributing TRAVA as reward, which means our 5 existing vaults will only give back EXP (one EXP for each second in 5 current farming vaults). This change supports NFT owners to gain EXP to enter Heuristic Farming with better rewards.

In the new Farming mechanism, we provide  5 more vaults for Heuristic Farming, and you can deposit as many knights as you want into each Vault, provided that those knights have the same rarity as that Vault. Rewards from Heuristic Farming are rTRAVA tokens and EXP (one EXP for every 3 seconds in the vault). The higher EXP, the higher the APR, the higher the rTRAVA reward.

Normal Farming

Heuristic Farming

Number of vaults

5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities

5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities

Number of Knights allowed in one vault

1 Knight

≥≥1 Knight

Reward in tokens

None

rTRAVA

EXP reward

One EXP is released for each second Knights in the vaults

One EXP is released for 3 second Knights in the vaults

With the new and improved mechanism, the EXP points are a crucial element in the development of the Trava Knight NFT journey. Like the current Farming mechanism, Heuristic Farming also has a Polishing mechanism. The polishing mechanism in Heuristic Farming helps NFT owners maintain 100% rewards and supports increasing EXP and APY.

Note that, Knights with 0 EXP still gain rewards from Heuristic Farming. Moreover, with rTRAVA from Heuristic Farming, users can auto-stake in our rTRAVA with no locking period in our Staking Program. rTRAVA then can be locked in Trava Governance vault to gain locking power as veTRAVA and earn more rewards.

EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault.  Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault  We’ve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items).  You can see your EXP  either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace.  Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs. However, when you withdraw your Knight NFT, disassemble and reassemble with different items to get another Knight NFT, your Armoury NFTs will have different EXPs.  For example: You open 4 chests and get: Helmet, Shield, Armour and Weapon. You assemble them into a Knight NFT and farm in our vault. After 24h, the EXPs for Armoury NFTs are as follow:      Weapon EXP: 86400      Shield EXP: 86400      Armor EXP: 86400      Helmet EXP: 86400  So EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400 (86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400  After 24h, you withdraw your Knight NFT to reassemble with Armoury NFTs you buy on Trava NFT Marketplace. Suppose, those Armoury NFTs you bought have been already farmed in vault before and have the EXPs as follow:      Weapon EXP: 86400      Shield EXP: 100000      Armor EXP: 320000      Helmet EXP: 210000  Thus, the EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow: (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100 (86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100  There will be a lot of benefits for NFT owners to have high EXPs. The more EXP you have, the more value the NFT will be. This can help you to distinguish NFT value from other NFTs of the same type and rarity. Moreover, the EXP will be applied in our Trade-up Mechanism which will be launched soon. In the future, EXP will be used with Credit Score and applied to NFT-collateralization. It can be said that EXP is an important factor in Trava Knight NFT to reach our goal of collateralization.', 'Heuristic Farming (Farming based on EXP)  When the new Farming mechanism commences, our 5 current Farming vaults will stop distributing TRAVA as reward, which means our 5 existing vaults will only give back EXP (one EXP for each second in 5 current farming vaults). This change supports NFT owners to gain EXP to enter Heuristic Farming with better rewards.  In the new Farming mechanism, we provide  5 more vaults for Heuristic Farming, and you can deposit as many knights as you want into each Vault, provided that those knights have the same rarity as that Vault. Rewards from Heuristic Farming are rTRAVA tokens and EXP (one EXP for every 3 seconds in the vault). The higher EXP, the higher the APR, the higher the rTRAVA reward.  Normal Farming  Heuristic Farming  Number of vaults  5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities  5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities  Number of Knights allowed in one vault  1 Knight  ≥≥1 Knight  Reward in tokens  None  rTRAVA  EXP reward  One EXP is released for each second Knights in the vaults  One EXP is released for 3 second Knights in the vaults  With the new and improved mechanism, the EXP points are a crucial element in the development of the Trava Knight NFT journey. Like the current Farming mechanism, Heuristic Farming also has a Polishing mechanism. The polishing mechanism in Heuristic Farming helps NFT owners maintain 100% rewards and supports increasing EXP and APY.  Note that, Knights with 0 EXP still gain rewards from Heuristic Farming. Moreover, with rTRAVA from Heuristic Farming, users can auto-stake in our rTRAVA with no locking period in our Staking Program. rTRAVA then can be locked in Trava Governance vault to gain locking power as veTRAVA and earn more rewards.

,What is backing per TOD?,"In Trava Finance, “Backing per TOD” refers to the real asset value that supports each TOD token, a token associated with the Trava Knight NFT ecosystem.

⸻

🧱 What Is TOD?
	•	TOD stands for Token of Destiny, used primarily in Trava Knight auctions and related NFT utilities.
	•	Users obtain TOD through auctions or in-game mechanisms.
	•	It has economic value backed by actual assets, which is where “Backing per TOD” comes in.

⸻

💰 What Does “Backing per TOD” Mean?

Term	Description
Backing per TOD	The amount of reserve asset (e.g., BUSD, TRAVA, or another token) that supports 1 TOD token
Why it matters	Prevents TOD from being overinflated or worthless; it maintains value integrity
Backing sources	Funds collected from auctions, protocol fees, or specific allocations in the NFT ecosystem
Real-time value	Often shown on the auction dashboard or Knight NFT section in Trava Station


⸻

📌 Example

If Trava has collected $100,000 in value through Knight auctions and has 1,000,000 TOD in circulation:

\text{Backing per TOD} = \frac{100,000}{1,000,000} = 0.10 \, \text{USD}

So, each TOD is backed by $0.10 worth of real asset.

⸻

🔒 Why Is This Important?
	•	🎯 Ensures value trust in TOD during auctions
	•	🛡️ Prevents manipulation or inflation of in-game currency
	•	📊 Helps users estimate risk and reward when bidding in NFT auctions

⸻

Would you like help locating the current “Backing per TOD” in the Trava Station interface or a breakdown of how it influences Knight auction strategy?","In Trava Finance, TOD refers to the Trava Ownership Dollar, which is a stable-value token backed by assets in the Trava ecosystem. The “Backing per TOD” represents the value of collateral or reserves that support each TOD token in circulation.

⸻

🪙 What is TOD (Trava Ownership Dollar)?
	•	TOD is a synthetic stable asset issued within Trava’s ecosystem.
	•	It’s soft-pegged to $1 USD, but its value is collateral-backed, not algorithmically maintained like UST was.
	•	TOD is used for:
	•	Lending & borrowing
	•	Governance fees
	•	Payment in NFT and auction features
	•	Internal stable medium of exchange

⸻

📊 What Does “Backing per TOD” Mean?

Term	Definition
🧮 Backing per TOD	The total USD value of assets backing TOD divided by the total TOD supply
📦 Collateral types	May include stablecoins, veTRAVA-locked value, lending pool collateral, or reserve TRAVA

For example:
	•	If Trava holds $1,200,000 in reserve
	•	And 1,000,000 TOD are in circulation
⇒ Backing per TOD = $1.20
This means each TOD is overcollateralized by 20%.

⸻

🧠 Why It Matters

Reason	Explanation
🔐 Trust & Stability	A high backing ratio increases TOD holders’ confidence
📉 Liquidation Risk	Overcollateralization protects against price swings
🧱 Lending Foundation	TOD is used as a base asset in custom lending pools
📈 Value Signal	A backing > $1 suggests strong ecosystem health


⸻

🔍 Where to See Backing per TOD

You can typically view it on:
	•	The Trava Dashboard
	•	Trava’s Docs or Medium posts
	•	Smart contract reserves on BSCScan if you know the TOD contract address

typical case of retrieving summary content from blog trava main page,What is Token Health and how can it measure a crypto risk?,"In Trava Finance, Token Health is a risk assessment metric designed to evaluate the financial safety and stability of a crypto asset within the Trava lending ecosystem. It helps determine how suitable a token is to be used as collateral or borrowed in lending pools.

⸻

🧠 What Is Token Health?

Token Health is a quantitative score or profile generated by analyzing multiple on-chain and market factors, aiming to measure the risk associated with a specific token.

| 🔍 It answers:
	•	Is this token safe to use as collateral?
	•	How likely is it to become illiquid or volatile?
	•	What are the risk signals based on its past behavior?

⸻

📊 What Factors Does Token Health Include?

Risk Metric	Description
💹 Volatility	Measures price fluctuations over time. High volatility = higher risk.
💧 Liquidity	Assesses how easily the token can be bought/sold on DEXs/CEXs. Low liquidity = liquidation danger.
🏦 Market Cap Stability	Tracks how stable the market cap is over time.
📉 Trading Volume	Consistent volume suggests lower manipulation risk.
🧾 Historical Price Crashes	Tracks frequency and depth of sudden drops (e.g., >30%).
🧠 Reputation Score	Based on social metrics, community trust, listings, etc.
⚠️ Depeg Risk (for stablecoins)	For stablecoins like USDT/BUSD, Token Health watches how closely it tracks $1.00


⸻

📈 How Is It Used in Trava?
	•	A token with strong Token Health:
	•	✅ Can be used as collateral in lending pools
	•	✅ Might have a higher loan-to-value (LTV) or liquidation threshold
	•	A token with poor Token Health:
	•	❌ Might be restricted or given conservative risk parameters
	•	⚠️ Could be subject to tighter borrowing limits or higher liquidation penalties

⸻

📌 Example

Token	Health Score	Lending Use
ETH	9/10	✅ High LTV, safe collateral
DOGE	5/10	⚠️ Lower LTV, medium risk
UST (2022)	1/10	❌ Not allowed or delisted


⸻

🧭 Why It Matters

Token Health helps protect:
	•	🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Lenders: from collateral collapse
	•	🤖 Protocol: from insolvency
	•	📉 Borrowers: from unexpected liquidations

⸻

Would you like a comparison of Token Health scores between two tokens you’re considering lending or borrowing (e.g., BUSD vs USDT)?","Token Health in Trava Finance is a risk evaluation metric that helps assess the stability and reliability of a cryptocurrency token. It is designed to measure how “healthy” or risky a token is for lending, borrowing, staking, and DeFi integrations within the Trava ecosystem.

⸻

🧠 What Is Token Health?

Token Health is a quantitative score assigned to each token, based on multiple on-chain and off-chain risk factors.
It is used by:
	•	🏦 Lending pool creators to decide which assets to support
	•	🤖 Algorithms to determine safe collateral/borrowing limits
	•	📊 Users to evaluate whether a token is stable enough to interact with

⸻

📏 How Is Token Health Measured?

Token Health includes a composite of risk-related metrics, such as:

Factor	Description
📈 Price Volatility	Higher volatility = lower health (less reliable for collateral)
🔀 Liquidity	Low liquidity = high slippage and liquidation risk
🧱 On-chain Utilization	How frequently and widely the token is used in DeFi protocols
📉 Market Depth	Order book depth — thinner books = more fragile price
⛓ Smart Contract Risk	Audit status, exploit history, centralization concerns
🧠 Historical Performance	Past depegs (for stablecoins), sharp crashes, black swan exposure

Each token is given a numerical score or color-coded status, e.g.:
	•	🟩 Healthy (good to use as collateral)
	•	🟨 Moderate (okay, but watch volatility)
	•	🟥 Risky (discouraged for secure DeFi use)

⸻

🎯 Why Does Token Health Matter?

Use Case	Benefit
🏦 Safer Lending Pools	Pool creators use Token Health to approve/reject token listings
🔐 Lower Liquidation Risk	Healthy tokens are less likely to cause forced liquidations
💼 DeFi Strategy Optimization	Users can select low-risk tokens for staking/borrowing
⚠️ Avoid Bad Collateral	Prevents using depegged or thin-liquidity assets as loan collateral


⸻

📍 Where to View Token Health
	•	Trava App: When selecting tokens in Lending Pools or BRicher
	•	Trava Tramlines: Used in credit and risk analysis layers
	•	Docs or DAO Votes: Health score may be cited when adding/removing assets

⸻

🔄 Example: Risk Comparison

Token	Volatility	Liquidity	Token Health
USDC	Low	High	🟩 Healthy
TRAVA	Medium	Medium	🟨 Moderate
ANYSWAP	High	Low	🟥 Risky

""content"": ""What is Token Health?

Token Health is an index to evaluate the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava is the world-first lending platform that provides this index by collecting and aggregating various types of data from blockchain networks. The health of each token is evaluated as a specific value in the range of [0; 1000]. This health index gives the users a comprehensive overview of tokens in the cryptocurrency world and thus facilitates TRAVA lending and other DEFI businesses.
Original features in Trava Token Health

Standardizing value for each indicator: There have been a few projects providing information on tokens such as Coingecko, CoinMarketCap, LunarCrush, CREAM Finance, DMM Exchange, etc. They typically present multiple types of on-chain data represented by raw numbers only. For example, they show the market capitalization of tokens but do not standardize those values, which makes it harder for users to understand the meaning of the values or make a comparison among different tokens. Performing standardization for the numeric indicators, Trava allows users to quickly assess different tokens in terms of MarketCap, Trading Volume, Token Price, etc.

Aggregate all indicators into a single index: Similar projects simply present multiple token indicators to users without combining them into a single index to make a comprehensive assessment of tokens. Trava Token Health Model, which is a user-oriented model, has been built to address this inconvenience by computing those separate indicators and combining all of them into an insightful index, i.e., Token Health. Users can use this single value to evaluate the health of a token and can quickly decide to invest in the token or not.

Utilizing both absolute and relative indicators: The absolute indicators are commonly used in many token-analyzing projects, while relative values are typically being overlooked. The absolute and separated values do not provide many complete insights, as those values ​​are not correlated with each other. Different from other projects, Trava makes use of both absolute and relative indicators to evaluate the Token Health in the most precise and overall manner. Let us take an example with tokens A and B. The trading volume of token A is $100M, while that of token B is $10M. People tend to quickly jump to the conclusion that token A outweighs token B with regards to the trading volume. However, when considering the market cap of the two tokens, it shows that the MarketCap of token A is 1000 times greater than that of token A. Thus, in the correlation with the MarketCap, the trading volume of token B is in fact much more impressive than that of token A. The example shows that, by combining absolute and relative indicators, Trava Model provides more comprehensive insights compared with related projects.

Customized UI for each user: The UI for Trava Token Heath can be customized for individual preference. Trava provides users with the leaderboard of all tokens, ranked by the total score (i.e., Token Health) or other single indicators such as market cap, token price, and trading volume. Users can access the historical charts of each indicator to get more insights. Moreover, what makes Trava Token Health special compared to the related projects is that Trava enables users to customize the charts based on their preferences. For example, they can add their favorite tokens with their preferable indicators in a single chart to compare and evaluate multiple tokens in an easy, time-saving, and elegant manner.

Various types of indicators: The Trava Token Health model is constructed based on various parameters in different aspects of DeFi. There are seven main parameters; all are selected and analyzed under a strict process before being deployed to ensure the most reliability and creditworthiness. In addition to the absolute values, we also calculate and analyze the relative values such as: the price over the highest score or the trading volume over the MarketCap. We also consider the fluctuation of the values over time. The detailed model will be presented in the next section
Trava Token Health model

Trava has studied and developed an exclusive token rating model. The model takes into account various types of data. At present, the data is grouped into seven main indicators including (1) Market cap, (2) Number of transactions, (3) Volume of transactions, (4) Number of holders, (5) Distribution of tokens to holders, (6) Price, and (7) Price stability. Each indicator in turn is evaluated based on several sub-parameters.
The use of Trava Token Health

One of the significant benefits of Token Health is to reduce risks. When participating in the crypto world, users have to face many types of risks such as token price crashes or collateral liquidation when borrowing. Token Health will be a useful tool for users to minimize these risks. They can determine which tokens should not be invested at certain times to avoid risks. Let us take an example of how two major risks can be addressed by Trava Token Health:

    Risk of token liquidity. In the DeFi field, price fluctuations can result in risks of loan liquidation for both the pool owners and liquidity providers. With Trava Token Health, the pool owner can choose stable price tokens to allow performing actions in the pool to avoid this risk.
    Risk of token inflation. Tokens with high inflation are more likely to have a price crash. Users in DeFi can suffer significant losses due to such crashes. With Trava Token Health, users have a full overview of token price, using our price stability indicator, the price over the highest score, or the Token Health index. This information is an effective tool for users to avoid the risk of tokens’ price crashes.

Moreover, Trava Token Health assists users to make optimal decisions on token investing. In the past, choosing which tokens to invest, lend or borrow, was a major problem for users in the crypto world because there was no credible basis for them to assess the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava Token Health allows users to observe the history of multiple token indicators and the overall Token Health index to be more confident when making their investment decisions.""

      ""content"": ""**Technical Update: Beta Version of Trava Token Health**\nPublished in\n5 min readOct 6, 2021\nShare\n \nAlpha Version glimpse back\n**Token Health** is the innovative index developed by Trava to evaluate the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Unlike other models, Trava standardizes the numeric value of each indicator into the range of [0;1000] and then aggregates all indicators into a single index. This helps users to easily evaluate the token and make investment decisions promptly. Moreover, Trava uses both absolute and relative calculation when assessing indicators to increase the precision and accuracy of Token Health.\nThe Trava Token Health model is now built on 7 indicators, including: (1) Market Cap, (2) Number of transactions, (3) Trading volume, (4) Number of holders, (5) Distribution of tokens to holders, (6) Price, and (7) Price stability. It is a helpful tool for users to minimize the risks related to token price and liquidity. Trava also allows users to observe the history of the seven indicators and the overall Token Health index so that they can easily make their investment decisions.\nRead more about Trava Token Health .\n \nUpdate for Beta Version\n**Number of tokens being enriched**. Trava Team has upgraded the Token Health from Alpha Version to Beta Version with significant features. Trava extracts and enriches data on a large number of tokens from different blockchain networks. So far, we have evaluated the health of tokens on 3 blockchains, including 370 tokens on Ethereum, 376 tokens on BSC and 5 tokens on Polygon. Moreover, during the analyzing process, we aggregate data of the original token and its pegged tokens on other blockchain networks. For example, when calculating the trading volume of ETH, we take into account the trading volume of both ETH and Binance-Peg Ethereum Token on the BSC network.\n**Easily understandable written reports being generated**. As a great update for the Alpha Version, we now provide users with automatically written reports for tokens. Rather than spending time on complicated values which require a strong knowledge and experience in the crypto field, users now can understand the token with ease. The written reports are very helpful for both experts and crypto newbies to effortlessly apprehend the practical meaning hidden behind the statistical indicators. Users no longer need to worry about doing complicated analyses themselves as the Beta Version of Trava Token Health has already assisted them in the whole process and satisfied their information needs.\n**Recommendations for trading actions**. There is a substantial improvement needed to be pointed out in the Beta Version. Along with the written reports of a token, we now are able to make recommendations to users on their trading actions. Available actions suggested by Trava Token Health are: buy, not buy, sell, not sell, deposit, and withdraw. Those actions are recommended to users with an insightful review and thorough analysis. Users can use the suggestions as additional references before arriving at any major decision.\n**Definition and history of indicators being added.** This version of Token Health also provides the meaning of each indicator to support users more effectively. The history of every indicator is available as well, so that users can get a comprehensive overview of their concerning tokens.\n \nFuture scope of Token Health in Trava Lending Pool\nThough having many considerable improvements in this version, we are continuing to upgrade Trava Token Health and we will apply it in the Trava Lending Pool. Lenders and borrowers will be equipped with strong support in lending and borrowing actions. We can recommend to users which tokens they should lend, which ones they should borrow and which ones are good for collateral. Pool owners can also use our token reports and check the history of the token to make good decisions on which tokens they should add to their pools. Trava Team will work harder to generate more comprehensive and insightful token reports that are able to help newbies master their crypto world.\n \nUI\nGo to the site: https://scoring.trava.finance/tokens-health\nIn the Health Overview Token, you will see the radar chart presenting 7 different scores for 7 indicators: Market Cap Scorem Price Over Highest, Daily Tc Score, Volume Score, Holders Score, Distribution Score and Price Stability Score; and one single aggregated index — Health Score. At the right of the chart, you will see the Token Health History which allows you to assess the whole history of Token Health of one specific token. Under the chart, there is “Analyze token”, this function will automatically generate a written report for the token providing you with the analysis you need.\nWhen you click on “Analyze token”, a detailed analysis report together with suggestions from our team will be displayed, which is a very useful reference for you to make your investment decisions.\nIn this version, we also add the meaning of each indicator to help users with deeper understanding."",

Token Health is an index to evaluate the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava is the world-first lending platform that provides this index by collecting and aggregating various types of data from blockchain networks. The health of each token is evaluated as a specific value in the range of [0; 1000]. This health index gives the users a comprehensive overview of tokens in the cryptocurrency world and thus facilitates TRAVA lending and other DEFI businesses. Original features in Trava Token Health  Standardizing value for each indicator: There have been a few projects providing information on tokens such as Coingecko, CoinMarketCap, LunarCrush, CREAM Finance, DMM Exchange, etc. They typically present multiple types of on-chain data represented by raw numbers only. For example, they show the market capitalization of tokens but do not standardize those values, which makes it harder for users to understand the meaning of the values or make a comparison among different tokens. Performing standardization for the numeric indicators, Trava allows users to quickly assess different tokens in terms of MarketCap, Trading Volume, Token Price, etc.  Aggregate all indicators into a single index: Similar projects simply present multiple token indicators to users without combining them into a single index to make a comprehensive assessment of tokens. Trava Token Health Model, which is a user-oriented model, has been built to address this inconvenience by computing those separate indicators and combining all of them into an insightful index, i.e., Token Health. Users can use this single value to evaluate the health of a token and can quickly decide to invest in the token or not.  Utilizing both absolute and relative indicators: The absolute indicators are commonly used in many token-analyzing projects, while relative values are typically being overlooked. The absolute and separated values do not provide many complete insights, as those values \u200b\u200bare not correlated with each other. Different from other projects, Trava makes use of both absolute and relative indicators to evaluate the Token Health in the most precise and overall manner. Let us take an example with tokens A and B. The trading volume of token A is $100M, while that of token B is $10M. People tend to quickly jump to the conclusion that token A outweighs token B with regards to the trading volume. However, when considering the market cap of the two tokens, it shows that the MarketCap of token A is 1000 times greater than that of token A. Thus, in the correlation with the MarketCap, the trading volume of token B is in fact much more impressive than that of token A. The example shows that, by combining absolute and relative indicators, Trava Model provides more comprehensive insights compared with related projects.  Customized UI for each user: The UI for Trava Token Heath can be customized for individual preference. Trava provides users with the leaderboard of all tokens, ranked by the total score (i.e., Token Health) or other single indicators such as market cap, token price, and trading volume. Users can access the historical charts of each indicator to get more insights. Moreover, what makes Trava Token Health special compared to the related projects is that Trava enables users to customize the charts based on their preferences. For example, they can add their favorite tokens with their preferable indicators in a single chart to compare and evaluate multiple tokens in an easy, time-saving, and elegant manner.  Various types of indicators: The Trava Token Health model is constructed based on various parameters in different aspects of DeFi. There are seven main parameters; all are selected and analyzed under a strict process before being deployed to ensure the most reliability and creditworthiness. In addition to the absolute values, we also calculate and analyze the relative values such as: the price over the highest score or the trading volume over the MarketCap. We also consider the fluctuation of the values over time. The detailed model will be presented in the next section Trava Token Health model  Trava has studied and developed an exclusive token rating model. The model takes into account various types of data. At present, the data is grouped into seven main indicators including (1) Market cap, (2) Number of transactions, (3) Volume of transactions, (4) Number of holders, (5) Distribution of tokens to holders, (6) Price, and (7) Price stability. Each indicator in turn is evaluated based on several sub-parameters. The use of Trava Token Health  One of the significant benefits of Token Health is to reduce risks. When participating in the crypto world, users have to face many types of risks such as token price crashes or collateral liquidation when borrowing. Token Health will be a useful tool for users to minimize these risks. They can determine which tokens should not be invested at certain times to avoid risks. Let us take an example of how two major risks can be addressed by Trava Token Health:      Risk of token liquidity. In the DeFi field, price fluctuations can result in risks of loan liquidation for both the pool owners and liquidity providers. With Trava Token Health, the pool owner can choose stable price tokens to allow performing actions in the pool to avoid this risk.     Risk of token inflation. Tokens with high inflation are more likely to have a price crash. Users in DeFi can suffer significant losses due to such crashes. With Trava Token Health, users have a full overview of token price, using our price stability indicator, the price over the highest score, or the Token Health index. This information is an effective tool for users to avoid the risk of tokens’ price crashes.  Moreover, Trava Token Health assists users to make optimal decisions on token investing. In the past, choosing which tokens to invest, lend or borrow, was a major problem for users in the crypto world because there was no credible basis for them to assess the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava Token Health allows users to observe the history of multiple token indicators and the overall Token Health index to be more confident when making their investment decisions.']",0.8845046162605286,0.8957143425941467,True,True

These events could be an attempt to manipulate the market by centralized factors, the effort to attack the protocol, or other unexpected situations.\n \n**Why do we need a Security Advisory Board?**\nIn the world of blockchain, the biggest thing is users’ trust in a protocol based on their development potential and strong security.\nAlthough blockchain technology is secure, decentralized, and distributed, the risks still remain in many forms, especially in cryptocurrency. In fact, DeFi hacks are on the rise. Digital thieves had a big year in 2021, taking $3.2 billion in cryptocurrencies. This number is predicted to be even higher in 2022. In the first three months of this year, hackers have stolen $1.3 billion from exchanges, platforms, and private entities.\nFor that reason, we need to prepare for unexpected issues. As a long-term vision, Trava will soon implement the Trava Governance and go ahead with building an entire decentralized marketplace where the users are responsible for developing the protocol themselves.\nAt first, users with voting power will decide on critical terms of the Trava Lending Pool, such as adding or removing assets, changing the risk parameters, etc. In the long-term, these responsibilities are widened and affect the users-creation pools as well.\nDespite the advantages of a decentralized autonomous organization, especially in collecting the crowd’s wisdom before making a decision, this model brings the risks of being attacked or manipulated by a centralized entity, etc.\nTo be more specific, if most governance tokens are in the hand of centralized parties, it would be possible for a governance attack to occur where a centralized entity uses its users’ voting power to take over the governance proposals and voting.\nIn that case, it is necessary to have a group of people who can solve the problem quickly and effectively enough to prevent the worst scenario and consult reasonable strategies for avoiding the risks.\n \n**What are the primary roles of SAB?**\nAs mentioned, this group of people is responsible for the security of the Trava Governance, which is implied in some main points:\n * First, providing quick solutions for unexpected issues relating to the dramatic fluctuation of the market and hacking actions.\n * Second, recommending the strategy for improving the governance security.\n\n\n \n**Who are they?**\nGiven the crucial role of the SAB, in the beginning, this team combines experts who also take responsibility for the development of the Trava Ecosystem as a whole.\nWe would like to introduce the SAB team as below:\n * Mr. Minh Nguyen — CEO & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Duc Tran — Head of Security & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Thang Nguyen — CTO & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Quan Dinh — CPO & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Chung Dao — Strategy Advisor of Trava Finance- CEO & Co-founder Oraichain\n\n\nFirst, the security advisor board includes five people from the team, as mentioned above.

""content"": ""What is TRADAO?

TRADAO is the world’s first protocol supporting multi-chain deployment in DeFi 2.0, and also Web 3.0 compatible. TraDAO is protocol owned liquidity (POL), accumulating value through such activities of bonding and auto-compound staking which are regulated by Trava Treasury. As a product in Trava ecosystem, the liquidity owned by TRADAO protocol could be deposited in Trava Lending Pool to generate more profit and this profit will be shared among users in the entire Trava ecosystem.

TRADAO Protocol will issue a decentralized reserve currency — called TOD. The concept behind TOD token is that it is backed by a basket of assets in Trava Treasury that ensures it does not fall below its base value of $1. The TOD token will be released based on the “Mint & Burn” mechanism, managed by no one other than TRADAO protocol.
Why is TRADAO different compared to other OHM forks?

In comparison to other initiatives in the DeFi 2.0 space, TRADAO Protocol offers a number of unique advantages to users.
How does it work?

Our Bonding allows users to buy TOD at a discounted price compared with exchanges in other assets such as stablecoins, LP tokens, and so on. The number of TOD tokens that the bonder is entitled to will be vested in a certain term.

Bond Installment is a one-of-a-kind feature that allows users to buy more TOD with a little initial amount of assets, then leverage benefits in Staking Strategy, and pay off the debt. Your bond shall be automatically staked after you use Bond Installment.

Wallet Reputation will be integrated with this product in the form of a reference to decide which user will have more benefits (i.e, lower prepaid rate, lower interest fee rate, higher liquidation discount rate,…). For example, holding assets in the Trava Ecosystem can be considered as a condition to gain a high wallet reputation.

Our Staking allows bonders to stake their TOD token in our auto-compounding vault and earn rebase rewards, after receiving TOD tokens from bond sales. The rebase rewards are also from bond sales held in Trava treasury, or profit of the protocol.""

""content"": ""We are opening two public offering rounds to give our loyal users as well as our new investors more opportunities to take part in the TraDAO Protocol at the very first stage. In both rounds, participants will buy $TOD tokens in BUSD. The details of two rounds are as the table below:

To get off to a good start, Trava will contribute to TraDAO Protocol with $50,000 worth of 20,000 $TOD tokens. This support is to ensure initial liquidity of $TOD and show the commitment of Trava team in developing TraDAO protocol, thus bringing trust to our community and staying the true ideology of Trava since the beginning, that is a fair launch project and independent of any whale or VCs. The funds from sale will be used to back the $TOD sold and provide initial liquidity after listing.

If we are 100% subscribed, the sale will bring in $345,000. $105,000 will be deposited to the treasury to back initial supply. The remaining $240,000 will be added as liquidity. The LP will open on PancakeSwap with 240,000 BUSD and 20,000 $TOD, in addition to 85,000 $TOD from Public Offering and contribution of Trava Team. This means the starting price of $TOD is $12, and total initial liquidity on Pancakeswap is $480,000 of both tokens. Thus, the total Initial Supply of $TOD will be 105,000 $TOD.
How can I join Public Offering?

We will also open two (02) Rounds of Whitelist, which will then be merged to one Final Whitelist at the end. The two rounds open to welcome new Knights and incentives for Loyal Knights in the TRAVA ecosystem as follows:

    Whitelist Round 1 (will be live on Jan 21st) — Power up TRADAO — To welcome new members into TRAVA Ecosystem
    Whitelist Round 2 (will be live on Jan 28th) — Cheer up Trava Knights — To honor TRAVA loyal users

Participants in the Final Whitelist will have a lucky ticket in buying $TOD Token at the cheapest price before it hits the official launch on PancakeSwap. When you buy, you are removed from the whitelist; if some people buy less than their share, everyone who has not yet bought will get a higher allocation. The details of each Round will be released in our next announcements.

After the public offering rounds, we plan to open two strategies of Bonding and Staking for users to leverage their rewards and earn profit from them. We also have a plan to allow Bond Installment and Wallet Reputation for Bond purchases, which creates a perfect gateway for users with small funds to invest and profit from the protocol.""

It encourages users to build their own reputation and get special offerings and more benefits.\n_Wallet Reputation will be officially launched at_** _3.00 P.M UTC January 24th_** a _nd will be used to select participants in Whitelist round 2 for Public Offering._\n \nWhat is Wallet Reputation?\nWallet reputation to a set of token T (i.e., wallet T-reputation) is a parameter to evaluate the loyalty of holders to the tokens in the set, showing the trust and reputation of the holder in the community. A holder who owns a large number of tokens over a long period will have a high reputation.\nIn TraDAO Protocol, TRAVA, rTRAVA, farming TRAVA and farming rTRAVA are the tokens used to determine Wallet Reputation. TRAVA and rTRAVA are tokens kept in wallets of holders while farming TRAVA and farming rTRAVA are held in our vaults or that users deposit TRAVA and rTRAVA respectively. In the future, we will also add TOD token to evaluate the wallet reputation.\n \nBenefits of high Wallet Reputation?\n**_Lucky Tickets in Whitelist for TraDAO Public Offerings_** : Wallet reputation shall be used in selecting participants in one of two Whitelist rounds for Public Offering of TOD tokens. Users with a higher reputation will have a better chance of being whitelisted and getting the best deal on TOD.\n**_Incentive Discounts in Bond Purchases/Exchanges:_** The typical benefit for reputable wallets is the discount on bond programs. Moreover, wallet reputation could also be integrated with our Bond Installment to offer high-reputation wallets more benefits such as lower prepaid rate, lower interest fee rate, higher liquidation discount rate, etc.\n**_Other incentives in TRAVA Ecosystem such as TRAVA NFT Marketplace:_** Wallet Reputation also has a lot of room to expand and connect data from Trava Knight NFT and bring NFT owners a great profit.\n \nHow does it work?\nIn the initial version, the reputation tracking system is implemented based on the rules on time and balance. Generally, the larger the number of tokens a user holds or stakes for a certain period, the higher reputation rank the user will hold. There are five reputation ranks, from 1 to 5, where the fifth rank is the best one. Assume N is the minimum number of TRAVA, rTRAVA, farming TRAVA, and farming rTRAVA a wallet holds during the period of time from t1 to t2. Each rank Ri is associated with a threshold Ni. The reputation rank of the wallet is decided as shown in the following table:\n**_For example_** , for N1= 150,000; N2 = 300,000; N3 = 500,000; N4 = 1,000,000; N5 = 10,000,000, a user holding 2,000,000 TRAVA for the period of 15 days would be at rank 4 and another one who holds 750,000 TRAVA in this period of time will be at rank 3.\n \nNotes:\n * Since wallet reputation is determined over a period of time, the more TRAVA, rTRAVA, farming TRAVA and farming rTRAVA you hold as long as possible, the higher reputation rank your wallet will be, the more benefit you will get.\n * The tracking system, the threshold values, and the rules can be modified according to each bond program. Those are determined through the DAO."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-wallet-reputation-pioneering-feature-in-reputation-tracking-474281641a02?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----84-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""**Key notes**\n * Eligible whitelisted wallet addresses will be announced on 25th Jan\n * The Public offering round 1 will take place from Feb 4th, and Public offering round 2 is on Feb 9th\n * The Public offering currency is BUSD\n * The price of TOD token in two Public offerings and other details can be found \n * The details for round 2 of the Whitelist will be announced on Jan 26th"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introducing-tradao-whitelist-round-1-c32fe90e78bf?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----86-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.0625 } ] }",False,False,False,False,FALSE,False,,,,"['https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-tradao-protocol-a-breakthrough-into-defi-2-0-d549c782422c', 'https://blog.trava.finance/tradao-public-offering-announcement-eda810f6cb2']","['What is TRADAO?  TRADAO is the world’s first protocol supporting multi-chain deployment in DeFi 2.0, and also Web 3.0 compatible. TraDAO is protocol owned liquidity (POL), accumulating value through such activities of bonding and auto-compound staking which are regulated by Trava Treasury. As a product in Trava ecosystem, the liquidity owned by TRADAO protocol could be deposited in Trava Lending Pool to generate more profit and this profit will be shared among users in the entire Trava ecosystem.  TRADAO Protocol will issue a decentralized reserve currency — called TOD. The concept behind TOD token is that it is backed by a basket of assets in Trava Treasury that ensures it does not fall below its base value of $1. The TOD token will be released based on the “Mint & Burn” mechanism, managed by no one other than TRADAO protocol. Why is TRADAO different compared to other OHM forks?  In comparison to other initiatives in the DeFi 2.0 space, TRADAO Protocol offers a number of unique advantages to users. How does it work?  Our Bonding allows users to buy TOD at a discounted price compared with exchanges in other assets such as stablecoins, LP tokens, and so on. The number of TOD tokens that the bonder is entitled to will be vested in a certain term.  Bond Installment is a one-of-a-kind feature that allows users to buy more TOD with a little initial amount of assets, then leverage benefits in Staking Strategy, and pay off the debt. Your bond shall be automatically staked after you use Bond Installment.  Wallet Reputation will be integrated with this product in the form of a reference to decide which user will have more benefits (i.e, lower prepaid rate, lower interest fee rate, higher liquidation discount rate,…). For example, holding assets in the Trava Ecosystem can be considered as a condition to gain a high wallet reputation.  Our Staking allows bonders to stake their TOD token in our auto-compounding vault and earn rebase rewards, after receiving TOD tokens from bond sales. The rebase rewards are also from bond sales held in Trava treasury, or profit of the protocol.', 'We are opening two public offering rounds to give our loyal users as well as our new investors more opportunities to take part in the TraDAO Protocol at the very first stage. In both rounds, participants will buy $TOD tokens in BUSD. The details of two rounds are as the table below:  To get off to a good start, Trava will contribute to TraDAO Protocol with $50,000 worth of 20,000 $TOD tokens. This support is to ensure initial liquidity of $TOD and show the commitment of Trava team in developing TraDAO protocol, thus bringing trust to our community and staying the true ideology of Trava since the beginning, that is a fair launch project and independent of any whale or VCs. The funds from sale will be used to back the $TOD sold and provide initial liquidity after listing.  If we are 100% subscribed, the sale will bring in $345,000. $105,000 will be deposited to the treasury to back initial supply. The remaining $240,000 will be added as liquidity. The LP will open on PancakeSwap with 240,000 BUSD and 20,000 $TOD, in addition to 85,000 $TOD from Public Offering and contribution of Trava Team. This means the starting price of $TOD is $12, and total initial liquidity on Pancakeswap is $480,000 of both tokens. Thus, the total Initial Supply of $TOD will be 105,000 $TOD. How can I join Public Offering?  We will also open two (02) Rounds of Whitelist, which will then be merged to one Final Whitelist at the end. The two rounds open to welcome new Knights and incentives for Loyal Knights in the TRAVA ecosystem as follows:      Whitelist Round 1 (will be live on Jan 21st) — Power up TRADAO — To welcome new members into TRAVA Ecosystem     Whitelist Round 2 (will be live on Jan 28th) — Cheer up Trava Knights — To honor TRAVA loyal users  Participants in the Final Whitelist will have a lucky ticket in buying $TOD Token at the cheapest price before it hits the official launch on PancakeSwap. When you buy, you are removed from the whitelist; if some people buy less than their share, everyone who has not yet bought will get a higher allocation. The details of each Round will be released in our next announcements.  After the public offering rounds, we plan to open two strategies of Bonding and Staking for users to leverage their rewards and earn profit from them. We also have a plan to allow Bond Installment and Wallet Reputation for Bond purchases, which creates a perfect gateway for users with small funds to invest and profit from the protocol.']",0.8539471626281738,0.8596494793891907,True,True
