While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA also offers the credit score function based on financial data on-chain analysis as a useful tool that reduces risk and increases profits for all users.\nWe build our solutions on TRAVA.FINANCE whose smart contracts are deployed on BSC network, so the speed of transactions, gas fees, and robustness depend on BSC network. However, in the near future, we will allow cross-chain lending in our platform.\nPlease join the the Trava team and members of the community look forward to helping you understand and use Trava. ##\nWhy should we trust Trava?\nTrava Protocol has been audited and secured internally, by third parties (Hacken, Certik) and even Community Checks.\nCheck https://docs.trava.finance/security/ for more information. ##\n**How to interconnect with Trava protocol**?\nIn order to interconnect with Trava protocol, you need to deposit your asset into lending pools. After depositing, you will earn passive income, this income is based on the market borrowing demand.

Trava token is issued based on Binance Smart Chain’s BEP20 standard.\nTrava token is a functional utility token which will be used as the medium of exchange between participants on TRAVA.FINANCE in a decentralised manner. The goal of introducing Trava token is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on TRAVA.FINANCE, and it is not, and not intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public (or a section of the public) as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt; nor is it designed or intended to be used by any person as payment for any goods or services whatsoever that are not exclusively provided by the issuer. Trava token does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will Trava token entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. Trava token may only be utilised on TRAVA.FINANCE, and ownership of Trava token carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use Trava token as a means to enable usage of and interaction within TRAVA.FINANCE.\nTrava also provides the economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to contribute to and participate in the ecosystem on TRAVA.FINANCE, thereby creating a mutually beneficial system where every participant is fairly compensated for its efforts. Trava token is an integral and indispensable part of TRAVA.FINANCE, because without Trava token, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on TRAVA.FINANCE. Given that additional Trava token will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage, activity and contribution on TRAVA.FINANCE and/or proportionate to the frequency and volume of transactions, users of TRAVA.FINANCE and/or holders of Trava token which did not actively participate will not receive any Trava token incentives.\nTrava token is used in 4 main areas: (1) Reward (2) Collateral & Lending (3) Payment (4) Staking:\n 1. **Reward:** To incentivise users to provide liquidity to pools, pool owners can set up rewards paid in TRAVA token.\n 2. **Collateral and lending:** TRAVA tokens may be used as the basic collateral for loans and mortgages.\n 3. **Payment for lending fees:** As the native platform currency, TRAVA tokens may be used to pay for lending fees in TRAVA.FINANCE pools.\n 4. **Payment for pool management:** As the native platform currency, TRAVA tokens may be used by pool owners to pay for pool management by TRAVA.FINANCE.\n 5. **Payment for auction deposits:** In the NFT auction process, TRAVA tokens can be used as the deposit for purchase transactions.\n 6. **Payment for auction organization:** The NFT’s owners (auction organizers) may pay for auction fees with TRAVA tokens.\n 7. **Staking for a validator:** The data stored on the knowledge graph chain must be verified by validators. As an indication of commitment and service standard assurance, validators would be required to put up an amount of Trava token as a security deposit (i.e. a \""stake\"") before being entitled to participate in the ecosystem. Where validators commit offences (e.g. incorrect information, unacceptable down-time, or other malicious acts), this stake may be slashed.\n 8. **Staking to participate in the governance process:** The Trava token would allow holders to create and vote on on-chain governance proposals to determine future features of TRAVA.FINANCE, with voting weight calculated in proportion to the tokens staked (the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of TRAVA.FINANCE; it does not entitle Trava token holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such assets to token holders, or select the board of directors of these entities, or determine the development direction of these entities, does not constitute any equity interest in any of these entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint venture or partnership). ####\nToken Allocation\nTotal Supply — Capped at **5,000,000,000 TRAVA**\nWe distribute tokenomics with a long-term vision and sustainability for the project.

TRAVA also offers the credit score function based on financial data on-chain analysis as a useful tool that reduces risk and increases profits for all users.\nWe build our solutions on TRAVA.FINANCE whose smart contracts are deployed on BSC network, so the speed of transactions, gas fees, and robustness depend on BSC network.

It means you would be no longer entitled to the potential upside value gain. Whereas, by borrowing, you can still obtain these potential earnings (working capital) without losing your asset. You can borrow when unexpected expenses happen and leverage your holding assets for other investment opportunities. ##\n**How to borrow?**\nIn order to borrow, you need to deposit any asset to be used as collateral first (check out the Depositing & Earning FAQ section for more info). After depositing, you simply go to the “Borrow” section and click the “Borrow” button on the asset you want to borrow. Input the amount and approve the transaction. The borrowed amount is based on the available deposits that you used as collateral. ##\n**What is the maximum amount can I borrow?**\nThe maximum amount you can borrow depends on your deposited value and the available liquidity. Please notice the health factor and liquidation threshold indicators to guarantee your collaterals are in the state of safety. Besides, you can not borrow if there is not enough liquidity or if your health factor is too low. ##\n**What type of asset do I repay my loans?**\nWhen repaying a loan, the type of asset that you need to repay is in the same asset you borrowed. For example, if you borrow 1 BNB you will pay back 1 BNB plus interest accrued. Another way to pay back the loan is using your collateral. If you want to pay back the loan based on USD price you can borrow any of the available stable coins as USDC, DAI, USDT, etc. ##\n**How much interest would I pay for my loans?**\nWhen borrowing, the interest rate you need to pay depends on the borrowing rate which is determined from the supply and demand ratio of the asset.

While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA also offers the credit score function based on financial data on-chain analysis as a useful tool that reduces risk and increases profits for all users.\nWe build our solutions on TRAVA.FINANCE whose smart contracts are deployed on BSC network, so the speed of transactions, gas fees, and robustness depend on BSC network. However, in the near future, we will allow cross-chain lending in our platform.\nPlease join the the Trava team and members of the community look forward to helping you understand and use Trava. ##\nWhy should we trust Trava?\nTrava Protocol has been audited and secured internally, by third parties (Hacken, Certik) and even Community Checks.\nCheck https://docs.trava.finance/security/ for more information. ##\n**How to interconnect with Trava protocol**?\nIn order to interconnect with Trava protocol, you need to deposit your asset into lending pools. After depositing, you will earn passive income, this income is based on the market borrowing demand. Additionally, you can also borrow by using your deposited assets as collateral. ##\nDo I need to pay fees to interconnect with Trava protocol?\nInteracting with the protocol requires transactions and so transaction fees for BSC Blockchain usage, which depend on the network status and transaction complexity."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/faq"", ""rrf_score"": 0.08333333333333333 }, { ""content"": ""##\n**What is Health factor?**\nHealth factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds. ##\n**What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation?**\nThe health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated. In the case the health factor reduces, it means the value of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets also reduces, it can result in a risk of liquidation of your collaterals. ##\n**When do I need to repay the loan?**\nAs long as you maintain your health factor safe, you can borrow for an undefined period. There is no fixed time period to pay back the loan. However, the accrued interest of your borrowing will grow day by day, making your health factor decrease. When it reaches the threshold of liquidation, your deposited assets are more likely to fall into liquidation status. ##\n**How to repay the loan?**\nIn order to pay back the loan you go to the Borrowings section of your dashboard and click on the repay button for the asset you borrowed and want to repay.

With the support of the Users-owned Pool feature and the Trava Lending Pool, Trava is step by step achieving the goal of building a totally Decentralized Lending Marketplace, where the benefits of users are being put above all.\nIn the Trava ecosystem, the Decentralized Lending Marketplace involves two main lending services of Trava, including Trava Lending Pool and Pool Creation, and several supporting features, such as Trava Knight NFT to support the NFT-collateralization in the Lending Services, Trava Governance to enhance the decentralization aspect, etc. # Key Components of Trava Decentralized Lending Marketplace"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/decentralized-lending-marketplace-the-ultimate-vision-of-trava-28872e395e85?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----36-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""## [AMA Recap] For the Growth of Trava’s Finance Ecosystem\n ### In the AMA on May 8, Trava Team provided an overview of Trava Finance’s future activities, and answered questions about occurring issues.\nMay 10, 2023\nMay 10, 2023 ## TRAVA FINANCE ECOSYSTEM DISCOVERY: THE 5 MAIN ELEMENTS\n ### Trava Finance ecosystem and its 5 main elements: Trava Lending services and governance, analytics tools, Capital, Knight NFTs and Tickets.\nApr 28, 2023\nApr 28, 2023 ## How Trava Finance, Step By Step, Moves Towards A Decentralized Marketplace\n ### Trava Finance has always been aiming for a decentralized market, making efforts, updating technology and releasing various products to…\nMar 21, 2023\nMar 21, 2023 ## Introduction To veTRAVA Marketplace\n ### Along with the launch of Trava Governance, veTRAVA Marketplace brings Trava Finance to the next level of “Decentralized” by enabling…\nFeb 9, 2023\nFeb 9, 2023 ## [AMA Recap] All About Pool Creation"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/?source=post_page---author_recirc--a5a62b5e5211---------------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""####\nStep 3.

In addition, pool owners can also achieve the experience and required skills to manage a crypto lending pool successfully.\nIn terms of **depositors and borrowers** , they will have various pools to choose from. Depositors and Borrowers can determine the pools with suitable parameters for their purposes.\n**Borrowers** can have more options to borrow digital assets with different interest rates, liquidity mining, and levels of risk. In addition, various types of assets are used as collateral. In the near future, TRAVA Knight NFT is also expected to become one of these assets to give our users more opportunities to borrow more tokens.\nAs **Lenders** , users have more choices to lend tokens in many different lending pools. Thus, they have more opportunities to optimize their earnings through interest rates paid by borrowers and rewards from the liquidity mining programs of multi-pools.\nIn the process of Creating, Managing, and Joining the Pool, pool owners, depositors, and borrowers will be supported by many Analytic Tools from Trava Finance to have the most appropriate parameters for the pool. # About Trava Finance\nTrava Finance is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters, such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. Trava is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks.\n_Website_ _|__|__|__|__Medium_ _|__|_ ## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/why-trava-lending-services-is-unique-in-the-defi-world-1668a824a041?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----31-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07601351351351351 }, { ""content"": ""##\nTrava Pool Creation Components\nIn the Trava Multi-pool Ecosystem, there are three main components: - **Pool Owners** : Who create and manage their own lending pools. - **Users** : who use lending services (of Trava lending pool and user-owned lending pools) such as borrowing, depositing, etc. - **Trava Governance** : Who plays the significant roles in the decision-making process while running the ecosystem.\nEach of these components has its own roles and responsibilities that are shown in the infographic below:\nAs shown on the infographic, while pool owners can freely add new tokens (set risk parameters included) or set reserve conditions, they need to assist Governance’s opinion if wanting to make changes after that."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/user-guide/trava-pool-creation-user-guide"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 } ] }",False,False,False,False,FALSE,False,,,,['https://blog.trava.finance/official-launch-of-trava-lending-pool-and-liquidity-mining-program-a9b3e65cb2e5'],"['Key Functionalities of Trava Lending Pool Deposit: Users can deposit their assets to Trava Pool to earn APY.

For instance, you should increase your wallet balance with prestige coins and tokens, perform more transactions and become more active in the crypto market, maintaining good Loan-to-balance and Loan-to-investment ratios, supply more liquidity to lending pools, trade on lending DApps to earn as much profit as you can, avoid collateral liquidation while borrowing, and possess at least $1000 valuable token (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether, or BNB).\nBesides, you need to be credible users for a long time. It is because to avoid fraud, TRAVA calculates some credit score parameters based on their average values in the last k days, where k depends on the volatility of the crypto market.

TRAVA.FINANCE collects and aggregates all exchanges, loans, deposits, and other transactions of the wallet address across multiple DApps to calculate various intermediate parameters such as (i) the age of the address, (ii) its transaction amount, (iii) its frequency of transaction, (iv) its number of liquidations and (v) its total value of liquidations. Loan ratios. Loan ratios (debt ratios) represent the debt position of the account. It is divided into two sub-parameters, i.e., loan-to-balance ratio and loan-to-investment ratio. Circulating assets. This parameter represents how active users are in the crypto market. The more money they invest in the crypto market, the more creditworthiness they gain from others. This parameter is evaluated based on 2 sub-parameters, (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE (Return on equity). Trustworthiness of possessing assets. The last parameter for credit rating is the trustworthiness of the assets owned by the wallet address. The wallet can improve its credit score by possessing high-value and trustworthy digital assets. At present, TRAVA.FINANCE evaluates two types of digital assets only (i.e, Token and NFT).']"

How to attend Trava NFT Auction?,docs,"[{""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/nfts/trava-nft-auction"",
""content"": ""Rules
Auction is ONLY cancellable when it has NO BIDS. After the first bid comes in, neither you nor we can cancel it, as rules are written in the smart contract.
When the bidding countdown is less than 5 minutes left, every new bid will extend the countdown by 5 minutes;
Each bid price will be increased by at least 5% of the previous one. Once the countdown ends, the auction item will be obtained by the last/highest bidder;
The most important rule: 2.5% of the price increase for each bid is distributed to the previous bidder, and the remaining 97.5% would be the income of the auction publisher if it’s the last bid or returned to the bidder when it’s outbid.
With the rules, each bidder would either take the 5% share of the next bid or obtain the auction Knight with the price he/she offered. And the first bidder will additionally be free from distributing his/her own 5% to other people.
Note: The percentage that the later bidder pays for the earlier bidder is the same as the percentage that the sellers need to pay for the platform. So, 2.5% is also the amount auction publishers pay to the marketplace, which means that after receiving 97.5% of the final bidding price as income, sellers need to pay 2.5% of the income to the NFT marketplace.
Therefore, the final payment rate that the sellers receive is 95.06% of the final bid. This fee is utilized for marketing, operating, and functioning.
Seller (Auction Publishers)
First Bidders
Other Bidders
Last Bidder
Receive: ~95.06% of the final bidding price
Receive:
100% of his/her bidding capital
2,5% of the later bidding price
Receive:
2.5% of the later bidding price
97.5% of his/her bidding capital
Pay: the final bidding price
For example,
First, Alice offered a 1000 TRAVA bid in a new auction.
Secondly, Billy offered 1100 TRAVA
⇒ Alice would receive her own 1000 TRAVA and 2.5% of 1100 TRAVA, which would be 1027.5 TRAVA in total, and the extra 27.5 TRAVA is totally free money.
Finally, Michael offered 1200 TRAVA.
⇒ Then, Billy would get 97.5% of his 1100 TRAVA and 2.5% of 1200 TRAVA, that is 1102.5 TRAVA, still getting 30 TRAVA for free.
⇒ The auction publisher will receive ~ 95.06% of the final bidding price (1200 TRAVA). Therefore, the seller will receive ~ 1140.72 TRAVA and pay 29.25 TRAVA to the platform.

Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract. ##\n**How does Trava price NFTs?**\nTrava will provide the auction function for NFT assets. Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way. We also avoid the price fluctuation of NFT because the NFTs have been priced in the auction contract before. ##\n**What can I do with NFTs after the auction?**\nTRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT.\nMeanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price.

As of May 2021, there have been no lending projects that make use of NFT as collaterals, because unlike a fungible currency or common stock, NFT value is difficult to determine. TRAVA.FINANCE adds more flexibility to the illiquid world of NFT and allows NFT owners to earn an ROI without selling it.\nTRAVA.FINANCE offers an innovative feature that prices NFTs based on auctions. After the auction, borrowers can use their NFTs as collateral. TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right.

After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.\nThe auction process is as follows:\n 1. The NFT owner opens an auction session; she sets (i) the legal crypto used in the auction, (ii) the initial price for her NFT, (iii) the countdown time for the auction session, (iv) the mode for her auction (i.e., _auction-to-sell or auction-for-buy-right_), and other auction terms.\n 2. TRAVA.FINANCE users, who are interested in the NFT, can join in the auction session. To encourage users to participate in auctions, at the end of the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE randomly selects several bidders and rewards them with TRAVA tokens extracted from the auction fees. To guarantee that the bidders make their payment when they win the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE locks a number of their TRAVA tokens as soon as they join in the auction session and make a bid. When the auction finishes, they will immediately get their tokens back if they are not the winner. In case they are the winners, they can get their tokens back only if they pay for the auctioning NFT before the deadline.\n 3. In the _auction-to-sell_ mode, the auction winner will pay the owner the whole auction price to get the NFT.\n 4. In the _auction-for-buy-right_ mode, the auction winners have to pay a part of the auction price. We name the quotient of the amount the winners have to pay over the auction price \""_auction-paid ratio_ ”. The auction-paid ratio is calculated from the creditworthiness of the lender, borrower, NFT, and the auction terms. The NFT owners can use the cryptos paid by the auction winner as collateral for their loans. Once they repay their loan including the interest to the auction winners, they can get the NFT back. Otherwise, they will lose their NFT to the auction winners. These rules are all defined in the auction smart contract.\n\n\nTRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below.\n * **NFT owners** can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it. TRAVA.FINANCE thus increases the liquidity of NFTs and opens up a unique and exciting NFTFi marketplace.\n * Based on the given number of auction bids, **bidders** have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session. This rewarding mechanism provides incentives for users to actively make a bid in the auction.\n * **Auction winners** can get their desired NFT at a price lower than their bidding price (once NFT owners cannot repay the loan) or they can receive considerable interest from their loan to NFT owners (once NFT owners repay the loans and get their NFT back).\n * The credit scores of **NFT owners, auction winners, bidders,** and **NFTs** can be improved after auctions.\n\n\nThe auction mechanism for NFT can also be applied to any type of digital asset.

What are benefit for those who participate in the Trava Knight auction?,"blog, docs","[{""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/trava-knight-nft-introduction-to-auction-mechanism-version-1-eb72e6f97be4"",
""content"": ""Benefit for those who participate in the Trava Knight auction
Benefit for auction publishers (the sellers)
Auction publishers (or sellers) are those who open auctions for their Knights. Opening an auction allows auction publishers to set up their price floor for their Knights, which determines their minimum desired price, helping them avoid selling their Knights at an unwanted low price compared to the market price.
The auction opens a great opportunity for Knight owners to make profits without the need of disassembling their Knights to pieces and selling each item multiple times, which can cause wasted gas fees due to multiple transactions.
Benefit for bidders
Trava Knight auction is of benefit for bidders since it offers them the opportunity to get the full Knight, not every piece of armoury NFT on Trava NFT Marketplace. This helps bidders save more time in obtaining a Knight without finding and collecting armoury items to assemble.
The auction also offers bidders an excellent method to get their favorable Knights, which suits their needs for missions such as Farming, Expedition, Farming with EXP and PvP tournaments in the future.
Benefit for Trava Lending Pool
The NFT Auction is the first step toward Trava Finance’s long-term aim of allowing NFTs to be used as collateral in the Trava Lending pool.
By using an auction mechanism, the NFT will be priced and subsequently used as collateral in the Trava loan pool. This is a good method to vary the collaterals and give users more opportunities to lend assets.

It helps increase the utility of not only NFTs for NFT-collateralization, but also $TRAVA in our system as all the trading on the Marketplace is in $TRAVA.
Users can assemble Knight NFTs to join Trava Farming Programs (NFT Farming, Heuristic Farming) in different vaults for a great APY — the rarer the NFT, the higher APY. The longer staked in the vaults, Loyal Knight NFT holders will also have more benefits in our lending pool in the future.

Based on the given number of auction bids, bidders have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session. This rewarding mechanism provides incentives for users to actively make a bid in the auction.
Auction winners can get their desired NFT at a price lower than their bidding price (once NFT owners cannot repay the loan) or they can receive considerable interest from their loan to NFT owners (once NFT owners repay the loans and get their NFT back).
The credit scores of NFT owners, auction winners, bidders, and NFTs can be improved after auctions.
The auction mechanism for NFT can also be applied to any type of digital asset. In our road map, TRAVA.FINANCE will implement this auction feature for various types of digital assets (e.g., stock token, smart contract).

They are non-fungible, which naturally means that they are illiquid. Bringing liquidity to the NFT space would unlock a myriad of possibilities. As of May 2021, there have been no lending projects that make use of NFT as collaterals, because unlike a fungible currency or common stock, NFT value is difficult to determine. TRAVA.FINANCE adds more flexibility to the illiquid world of NFT and allows NFT owners to earn an ROI without selling it.\nTRAVA.FINANCE offers an innovative feature that prices NFTs based on auctions. After the auction, borrowers can use their NFTs as collateral. TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT. Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.\nThe auction process is as follows:\n 1. The NFT owner opens an auction session; she sets (i) the legal crypto used in the auction, (ii) the initial price for her NFT, (iii) the countdown time for the auction session, (iv) the mode for her auction (i.e., _auction-to-sell or auction-for-buy-right_), and other auction terms.\n 2. TRAVA.FINANCE users, who are interested in the NFT, can join in the auction session. To encourage users to participate in auctions, at the end of the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE randomly selects several bidders and rewards them with TRAVA tokens extracted from the auction fees. To guarantee that the bidders make their payment when they win the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE locks a number of their TRAVA tokens as soon as they join in the auction session and make a bid. When the auction finishes, they will immediately get their tokens back if they are not the winner. In case they are the winners, they can get their tokens back only if they pay for the auctioning NFT before the deadline.\n 3. In the _auction-to-sell_ mode, the auction winner will pay the owner the whole auction price to get the NFT.\n 4. In the _auction-for-buy-right_ mode, the auction winners have to pay a part of the auction price. We name the quotient of the amount the winners have to pay over the auction price \""_auction-paid ratio_ ”. The auction-paid ratio is calculated from the creditworthiness of the lender, borrower, NFT, and the auction terms. The NFT owners can use the cryptos paid by the auction winner as collateral for their loans. Once they repay their loan including the interest to the auction winners, they can get the NFT back. Otherwise, they will lose their NFT to the auction winners. These rules are all defined in the auction smart contract.\n\n\nTRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below.\n * **NFT owners** can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it. TRAVA.FINANCE thus increases the liquidity of NFTs and opens up a unique and exciting NFTFi marketplace.\n * Based on the given number of auction bids, **bidders** have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session.

The most important rule: **2.5%** of the price increase for each bid is distributed to the previous bidder, and the remaining **97.5%** would be the income of the auction publisher if it’s the last bid or returned to the bidder when it’s outbid.\n\n\nWith the rules, each bidder would either take the 5% share of the next bid or obtain the auction Knight with the price he/she offered. And the first bidder will additionally be free from distributing his/her own 5% to other people.\n_Note: The percentage that the later bidder pays for the earlier bidder is the same as the percentage that the sellers need to pay for the platform. So, 2.5% is also the amount auction publishers pay to the marketplace, which means that after receiving 97.5% of the final bidding price as income, sellers need to pay 2.5% of the income to the NFT marketplace._\n_Therefore, the final payment rate that the sellers receive is 95.06% of the final bid.

Opening an auction allows auction publishers to set up their price floor for their Knights, which determines their minimum desired price, helping them avoid selling their Knights at an unwanted low price compared to the market price. The auction opens a great opportunity for Knight owners to make profits without the need of disassembling their Knights to pieces and selling each item multiple times, which can cause wasted gas fees due to multiple transactions. Benefit for bidders Trava Knight auction is of benefit for bidders since it offers them the opportunity to get the full Knight, not every piece of armoury NFT on Trava NFT Marketplace. This helps bidders save more time in obtaining a Knight without finding and collecting armoury items to assemble. The auction also offers bidders an excellent method to get their favorable Knights, which suits their needs for missions such as Farming, Expedition, Farming with EXP and PvP tournaments in the future. Benefit for Trava Lending Pool The NFT Auction is the first step toward Trava Finance’s long-term aim of allowing NFTs to be used as collateral in the Trava Lending pool. By using an auction mechanism, the NFT will be priced and subsequently used as collateral in the Trava loan pool. This is a good method to vary the collaterals and give users more opportunities to lend assets.  ', 'Benefits of Knight NFTs Each of Knight and Armory NFTs represents a unique digital collectible that can be bought, sold, rented and put on auction on Trava Knight NFT Marketplace. It helps increase the utility of not only NFTs for NFT-collateralization, but also $TRAVA in our system as all the trading on the Marketplace is in $TRAVA. Users can assemble Knight NFTs to join Trava Farming Programs (NFT Farming, Heuristic Farming) in different vaults for a great APY — the rarer the NFT, the higher APY. The longer staked in the vaults, Loyal Knight NFT holders will also have more benefits in our lending pool in the future. In addition, you can get rewards from Trava Knight NFTs by playing the Battle Hand Mini-Game, and joining in Missions such as Expedition or Treasure Map.

Those transmuting their items need to pay a small fee in  $TRAVA, which depends on the rarity of each item.
Unlike the trade-up mechanism, in Transmutation, there is no failure rate which means users can always transmute their items successfully.
Check the detailed information about transmutation time and fee in the following table:   
Rarity
Copper
Silver
Gold
Diamond
Crystal
Forgery time
2 hours
4 hours
8 hours
16 hours

Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm.

You can see your EXP  either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace.



Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs.

What are the features of Trava Finance?,docs,"[{""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper"",
""content"": ""There are six salient features of TRAVA.FINANCE, including:
Crypto lending marketplace: TRAVA.FINANCE creates a marketplace in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and obtain greater earnings.
Semantic knowledge graph: TRAVA.FINANCE is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA.FINANCE to efficiently search for useful information such as (i) the amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses; (ii) the provenance of an NFT; (iii) aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc.
Data analysis: To reduce lending risks, TRAVA.FINANCE performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA.FINANCE recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, Loan to Value ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA.FINANCE also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools.
Credit score evaluation: Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can (i) reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool; and (ii) stimulate borrowing by defining a high Loan to Value ratio for borrowers with high credit scores.
Cross-chain identification and cross-chain lending: TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross- chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores.
NFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals: To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA.FINANCE allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn considerable amounts from the contract.
""}]",,,"{
      ""content"": ""Figure 1: Main features of TRAVA.FINANCE\nTRAVA.FINANCE (or TRAVA) is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrowing/lending interest rate, liquidity threshold, Loan to Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA.FINANCE offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA.FINANCE is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks.\nThe pool owners, who are an additional role to lenders and borrowers, can receive more earnings by devising a good lending strategy for their pools. Moreover, to reduce risks and stimulate lending and borrowing, TRAVA.FINANCE performs cross-chain data analysis on multiple blockchain networks to (i) recommend optimal pool parameters for pool owners and (ii) detect unusual transactions in their pools. The lending marketplace model of TRAVA.FINANCE will increase crypto liquidity and promote the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. There are six salient features of TRAVA.FINANCE, including:\n  * **Crypto lending marketplace** : TRAVA.FINANCE creates a **marketplace** in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and obtain greater earnings.\n  * **Semantic knowledge graph** : TRAVA.FINANCE is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA.FINANCE to efficiently search for useful information such as (i) the amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses; (ii) the provenance of an NFT; (iii) aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc.\n  * **Data analysis** : To reduce lending risks, TRAVA.FINANCE performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA.FINANCE recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, Loan to Value ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA.FINANCE also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools.\n  * **Credit score evaluation** : Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can (i) reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool; and (ii) stimulate borrowing by defining a high Loan to Value ratio for borrowers with high credit scores.\n  * **Cross-chain identification and cross-chain lending** : TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross- chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores.\n  * **NFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals** : To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA.FINANCE allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn considerable amounts from the contract.\n\n\nNextArchitecture\nLast updated 1 year ago\nWas this helpful?\n"",

      ""content"": ""Figure 3: An example of the cross-chain knowledge graph\nThe knowledge graph is one of the most fundamental components of TRAVA.FINANCE, which is responsible for storing and representing aggregated data from multiple blockchain networks. The graph and TRAVA.FINANCE protocols make independent blockchains interconnected and create the internet of hyper-linked blockchains, allowing DApps to address complex business in reality.\nFigure 3 shows an example of the knowledge graph. The circle represents an entity (or instance) of data such as a wallet address, a user, a lending pool, an NFT, or other types of digital assets. Each entity is associated with other entities in certain relationships, represented by directional arrows; the direction of an arrow is the direction of the relationship.\nThe white rectangles are the values for the data attributes of the entity. The example graph shows that the WalletAddress2 is on the Ethereum network and that address owns an NFT. Aggregated information of the NFT, such as the highest bid price, number of auctions, list of addresses ever owned, etc., are also represented in the knowledge graph.\nLet us assume that a user creates one address on the Bitcoin network and one address on the Ethereum network. Because there were no relationships among these addresses, the knowledge graph creates two anonymous users, i.e., AnonymousUser1 and AnonymousUser2. AnonymousUser1 owns the Bitcoin addresses (i.e., WalletAddress3), and AnonymousUser2 has one Ethereum address, i.e., WalletAddress1. Various information related to a wallet address is stored in the graph. For example, the WalletAddress3 entity contains the _average balance_ , the _total amount of ETHs transferred in and out_ , the _total number of transactions_ , or _the average, median, mode,_ and _highest number of ETHs transferred in one transaction._\nAssuming the user wants to increase his/her credit score or use up all of his/her cryptos as collateral for a loan, he or she can unify all addresses as one via the cross-chain identification protocol performed in only one TRAVA.FINANCE's transaction. After completing the transaction, the two anonymous users are linked by the _sameAs_ relationship.\nDepending on users’ needs, the cross-chain identification protocol also supports linking two wallet address entities by a _guarantee_ relationship. Once an address is lost, if all the addresses that guarantee the address confirm the loss, the address status will be claimed as _lost_ in the knowledge graph.\nWallet addresses can also be connected by a _transfer_ relationship. To ensure scalability, rather than detailed transactions, statistical and aggregated information on transactions is calculated and stored in that _transfer_ relationship. As in the knowledge graph example above, several remarkable pieces of information are saved, including _BlockchainAddress1 has transferred 400 ETHs in total to BlockchainAddress2; it is performed through 10 transactions, and the largest transaction transfers 200 ETHs._\nTo avoid junk addresses and junk digital assets, we do not store all blockchain entities in the knowledge graph. The number of transactions or the maximum of cryptos transferred in one transaction related to an NFT or an address needs to surpass a threshold so that the NFT and the address will be added to the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph can also represent other types of entities, relationships, and properties. We develop a unified interface so that the expansion of the knowledge graph can be done in a logical, consistent, effective, scalable, and standardized manner.\nAs the knowledge graph plays a crucial role, it can only be updated by a TRAVA.FINANCE’s validator, and this must be agreed upon by other validators on the network. The knowledge graph needs to be infinitely extended while the assigned number of TRAVA.FINANCEs is fixed and finite. Thus it is not possible to pay fees for updating the graph. However, there should also be a way to encourage validators to update and enrich the knowledge graph. To reconcile this contradiction, TRAVA.FINANCE requires and also encourages validators to update the knowledge graph.\nOn the one hand, validators must update the knowledge graph regularly, otherwise, they will be stripped of their validator role, and cannot earn rewards for appending new blocks or verifying transactions. On the other hand, each time enriching the knowledge graph, validators will gain the fame score, thereby gaining more priorities and indirectly having the opportunity to earn more TRAVA.FINANCE coins when joining the network.\nPriorities may include voting power or the privilege to unlock TRAVA.FINANCE tokens earlier than the standard time when receiving awards. Enriching the graph is a special kind of TRAVA.FINANCE transaction that requires no fee. Out of all transactions, graph-related transactions are extracted and stored separately in files along with their hash value. This allows validators and other nodes to (re)construct the graph more efficiently with their own graph database systems.\nPreviousArchitectureNextCross-chain Identification\nLast updated 3 years ago\nWas this helpful?\n"",

""}]",,,"{ ""number_of_documents"": 5, ""results"": [ { ""content"": ""Figure 4: Cross-chain identification\nThe cross-chain identification protocol plays an important role in the TRAVA.FINANCE architecture. It can be used to verify that multiple addresses on different chains belong to the same user. The protocol allows TRAVA.FINANCE to provide an overview of anonymous users, including their total cryptos and other digital assets, statistics for their transactions, and their relationships with other blockchain addresses. These types of information and relationships are stored on the cross-chain knowledge graph. The protocol can (i) improve the credit score of the users and their wallet address so that they can get favorable interest rates, (ii) save them transaction fees since they can use up all of their cryptos as collateral in a single transaction, and (iii) allow them to get their cryptos back when they lose one of their wallet address.\nTo implement the protocol, we develop a wallet application so that users can manage their accounts and prove their ownership of multiple accounts. The application provides users with two functionalities: _“Add account”_ and _“Create a proof of ownership”._ Users can add a new account to the wallet application in multiple ways, e.g., (i) create an account, (ii) import a private key, and (iii) connect to a hardware wallet.\nTo foster their DeFi transactions, they might need to prove that they are the owner of n addresses. To this end, they can use our wallet application to perform a transaction that activates the cross-chain identification protocol. Receiving the transaction, TRAVA validators check the accuracy of the data associated with the transaction. If the data is valid, the validators accept the transaction and write the **sameAs** relationship among the owners of the addresses to the knowledge graph.\nIn the following we describe our processing to verify the cross-chain identification of multiple wallet addresses. ####\nUser side\nAssume that a user would like to confirm her ownership for 3 accounts, the wallet creates a message containing 3 data elements, each includes a pair of a _chainId_ and a _public key_. Every element has a fixed size of 41 bytes: 8 bytes for the _chainId_ and 33 bytes for the _public key_. The data format is as follows:\n * data1 (41 bytes) := chainId1 (8 bytes) + pub1 (33 bytes)\n * data2 (41 bytes) := chainId2 (8 bytes) + pub2 (33 bytes)\n * data3 (41 bytes) := chainId3 (8 bytes) + pub3 (33 bytes)\n\n\nThe wallet uses the Merkle tree to hash the data and obtains the _rootHash_ (32 bytes)\n * rootHash := MerkleTree([data1,data2,data3]).getRoot()\n\n\nThe user then uses her 3 private keys to sign on the _rootHash_. Each signing creates a signature, named _si_ (64 bytes):\n * s1 := Sign(rootHash, prv1)\n * s2 := Sign(rootHash, prv2)\n * s3 := Sign(rootHash, prv3)\n\n\nFinally, a transaction is generated and broadcasted to validators. A sample of transaction payload is as follows:\n * Type (8 bytes): \""SameAs\""\n * Number (4 bytes): 3 // The number of addresses\n * Message (n*41 bytes): data1 data2 data3\n * Signatures (n*64 bytes): s1 s2 s3\n * Timestamp (8 bytes): 1619602364\n\n\nThe total size of a transaction to prove n accounts of the same user is: _20 + n * 105_ bytes ####\nValidator side\nReceiving the transaction, TRAVA validators verify the timestamp and then verify the signatures as follows. They first extract the message _{data1, … datan}_ and the list of signatures _{s1, … sn}_. From each data element _datai_ , the validators get the _chainId_ and the _public key_ (i.e., _pubi_). They use the Merkle tree to hash the data and regenerate the _rootHash_ :\n * rootHash := MerkleTree([data1, data2, data3]).getRoot()\n\n\nThe validators then use _pubi_ to verify signature _si_ on the rootHash:\n * verifySignature(rootHash, s1 , pub1) => valid/invalid\n * verifySignature(rootHash, s2 , pub1) => valid/invalid\n * verifySignature(rootHash, s3 , pub1) => valid/invalid\n\n\nOnce all signatures are valid, the validators agree that all accounts stored in the message belong to the same user. From n pairs of _chainId_ and _public key_ , the validators calculate the respective addresses of the user. To eliminate useless addresses, the validators perform additional checks on the age of the address, its average balance, or the total number of transactions related to the address. Finally, the validators store the _sameAs_ relationship among the valid addresses of the user on the knowledge graph.\nPreviousCross-chain Knowledge GraphNextCredit Score Evaluation\nLast updated 3 years ago\nWas this helpful?"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/cross-chain-identification"", ""rrf_score"": 0.16666666666666666 }, { ""content"": ""# Introduction To BRicher Auto Investing And Semi-auto Investing\nPublished in\n4 min readSep 16, 2022\nShare\nIntroduction to BRicher’s new functions\n _BRicher is a unique aggregator that composes multiple investment methods: providing liquidity, swapping, staking, depositing, and borrowing in the lending pools._\n_In summary, these composite strategies are automatically built so that users can get the most optimized one to maximize their profit. Moreover, unlike other aggregators, BRicher lets investors own their tokens so that they can take complete control of capital and investment plans._ # The first version of BRicher\nIn the first version, BRicher provided users with effective investment strategies with high returns and helped them keep track of their diaries (ROI and other critical parameters).\n_An investment strategy suggested by BRicher_\nHowever, the problem is that after discovering their best investment suggestion, users need to implement all the investing processes by themself, which is significantly time-consuming.

Performing all of these tasks in multiple DApps can be challenging and time-consuming.\nIn this case, the Semi-auto Investing function supports users effectively by allowing them to gradually execute the strategies on only one site — BRicher. That means even though users still need to invest step by step, there will be one button for each stage on BRicher’s interface for them to click on and complete the process easier. ## **_What benefit does it bring to users?_**\n* It is much more convenient than the Manual Investing feature, which requires users to access each DApps and execute the required steps.\n * Investors can control and keep track of each step of the investment implementation. That helps them to deeply understand the progress and, more importantly, make the modification in each step (cancel, for example) if necessary. # Introduction to Auto Investing function.\n ## **_What is the Auto Investing function?_**\nUpgraded from Semi-auto Investing, the Auto investing function requires users nothing but to click one only button.

While heading the new year — 2023 with more features, and utilities, let’s look back at the big picture of Trava Finance in 2022._\n \nA Glimpse of Trava Finance and the Trava Ecosystem\nTrava Finance is a DeFi protocol that aims to build the first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. Following that, besides the Trava Lending pool, Trava Finance will offer a flexible mechanism where users can create and manage their lending pools to start a lending business.\nThe ecosystem currently contains three main components, including Trava Lending pool, Trava Capital (TraDAO), and Trava Knight NFT, along with various supported features related to the semantic knowledge graph, data analytics, credit score evaluation, cross-chain identification, and cross-chain lending, etc.\n \nTrava Finance 2022 Milestones\n _Take a look at the critical achievements that we attained this year:_\nTrava Finance 2022 milestones\n \nTrava Finance 2022 Milestones\n _Take a look at the critical achievements that we attained this year:_\nTrava Finance 2022 milestones\n\nTrava Lending Pool\nAs the name suggests, Trava Lending Pool provides users with various lending services. In this case, users can deposit their tokens (there are above 15 assets supported) in the lending pools to get rewards with pretty high APY and APR. Besides that, they can also borrow assets from the lending pool by providing collaterals.\nIn 2022, multiple features related to the lending pool were implemented to maximize users’ experience:\n\n\nWith Trava Governance, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users a chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer the management decision completely to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project.\nGo along with that, Trava Governance Vault was implemented, allowing users to lock TRAVA and rTRAVA to gain rewards and voting power in the ecosystem.\nTrava Governance Empowerment\n\n\nFortune Mining is an important component of the Trava minigame series that encourage users to deposit into a special vault named Fortune Mining Vault. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm).\nThat means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones.\n \nTrava Finance 2022 Milestones\n _Take a look at the critical achievements that we attained this year:_\nTrava Finance 2022 milestones\n\nTrava Knight NFT\nTrava Knight NFT is one of the three key components in the Trava Ecosystem. It is the first step on our path to reaching our goal of NFT collateralization in our lending pool system.\nIn 2022, some critical features related to Trava Knight NFT have been opened.\n * **_Trava Knight NFT Auction_**\n\n\nNFT auction allows sellers and buyers to interact and agree on a price for the NFT that is being auctioned. In the Trava Knight NFT Auction, each NFT is evaluated clearly. These values will verify the position of Knight NFT in the Trava Lending Pool when NFT collateralization is available.\n * **_Trava Knight NFT Heuristic Farming_**\n\n\nBesides the five initial farming vaults, we provided five more vaults for Heuristic Farming that allows all Knights to participate in one or more vaults. Rewards from Heuristic Farming are rTRAVA tokens and EXP (one EXP for every 3 seconds in the vault). The higher EXP, the higher the APR, and the higher the rTRAVA reward.\n * **_Trava Knight NFT mini-game series_**\n\n\nTrava Knight NFT mini-game is a special game series that we open to optimize users’ experiences. The first minigame opened is The Battle Hand Mini-Game — a battle of wits inspired by a traditional game called Rock, Paper, Scissors. During the battle, Knight will have a chance to choose an appropriate action to compete with the competitor. The actions have the picture of each element in the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, and the rules are similar to the traditional game: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.\n * **_TOD Listing_**\n\n\nTOD is the native token of Trava Capital (rebranded from TraDAO). At the beginning of March 2022, we listed TOD on PancakeSwap and opened the Auto-compound staking and bonding mechanism.\nBond installment is a unique feature that allows bonders to buy more TOD with a certain amount of assets and pay the debt later. This type of bond offers users with small amounts of capital to obtain more bonds and then earn more profit from auto-compounding staking.\nSince May 2022, TraDAO protocol and the community have adjusted the strategy to adapt to the bad situation. However, the prolonged bear market caused the unstable development of several OHM forks, both big names and smaller ones, like TraDAO. That leads to the desire to make changes for the long-term development of the whole community. Following the community decision, we rebranded TraDAO to Trava Capital, which also means moving away from the OHM mechanism principle to approach the new model as venture capital.\n \nTrava Finance 2022 Milestones\n _Take a look at the critical achievements that we attained this year:_\nTrava Finance 2022 milestones\n\n**Analytics tools**\n _Besides these main products, Trava Finance provides users with various data analytics tools that support users in using not only Trava Finance products but making a reasonable investing decisions. One of them is BRicher._\n\n\nBRicher is a unique aggregator that composes multiple investment methods: providing liquidity, swapping, staking, depositing, and borrowing in the lending pools. These composite strategies are automatically built so that users can get the most optimized one to maximize their profit. Moreover, unlike other aggregators, BRicher lets investors own their tokens so that they can take complete control of capital and investment plans.\nTrava Finance ‘s new feature named — BRicher, an aggregator supporting users in their investing process\nAs a part of this inevitable wave, Trava Finance is now creating our own path as the first-ever protocol bringing a new type of asset in the form of a ticket — Trava Ticket. Going along with the idea, we develop a new generation of Tokenomics for NFT — Ticketomics, which includes max circulating supply and mint/burn mechanism.\nFollowing that, a ticket in Trava Finance is an exchangeable asset that allows users to own additional perks or access to products in the Trava Ecosystem. There are three types of tickets: Counter Ticket, Presale Ticket, and Incentive Ticket. Each has different usages, so that benefits users in different ways.\n \nCritical achievements in 2022\nThe support from the whole community leads us to critical achievements, take a look at what we have done and attained in the last 1 year:\nTrava achievements in 2022\n \nPartnership in 2022\n _Besides these achievements, it is grateful for us to build new relationships with various projects which play significant roles in supporting us in enriching the whole ecosystem._\nThis is an educational blog that provides readers, who are wise investors and knowledge-craved developers accurate information about the technology landscape, especially blockchain.\nFollowing the partnerships, TechFi and Trava Finance will leverage the background of both parties to tap into each other’s strengths and provide joint solutions related to technical support, business development, marketing and communication development, and academic support.\nRouter and Dfyn\nRouter Protocol and Dfyn are a true representation of the potential of cross-chain capable dApps. In order to further augment the extent of their interoperable functionalities and grow the capabilities of Trava Finance, we are thrilled to reveal the three-pronged strategic partnership that presents some key aspects: Trava Finance will integrate Router Widget, $TRAVA token is listed on the Router App, Dfyn will integrate Trava token health analytics. In addition, there are much more cooperation potentials that will bring mutual benefit given that both aim to enable cross-chain strategy.\nNFTb is one of the most secured LaunchPad platforms that allow artists to access DeFi opportunities while delivering the most outstanding user experience. By cooperating with NFTb, we opened a special presale ticket event.\n \nOur Community\nIn the very long journey we have been through, our community plays a key role in supporting us to attain critical achievements. In this one year, we appreciate the companions of the whole community and feel grateful that it’s expanding. That’s expressed in the increase in followers and members number on Medium, Twitter, Discord, and Telegram.\nTrava Finance community\nThank you so much for being with us through the good and bad times of this year. It’s the end of 2022, but the long journey is still ahead.

These events could be an attempt to manipulate the market by centralized factors, the effort to attack the protocol, or other unexpected situations.\n \n**Why do we need a Security Advisory Board?**\nIn the world of blockchain, the biggest thing is users’ trust in a protocol based on their development potential and strong security.\nAlthough blockchain technology is secure, decentralized, and distributed, the risks still remain in many forms, especially in cryptocurrency. In fact, DeFi hacks are on the rise. Digital thieves had a big year in 2021, taking $3.2 billion in cryptocurrencies. This number is predicted to be even higher in 2022. In the first three months of this year, hackers have stolen $1.3 billion from exchanges, platforms, and private entities.\nFor that reason, we need to prepare for unexpected issues. As a long-term vision, Trava will soon implement the Trava Governance and go ahead with building an entire decentralized marketplace where the users are responsible for developing the protocol themselves.\nAt first, users with voting power will decide on critical terms of the Trava Lending Pool, such as adding or removing assets, changing the risk parameters, etc. In the long-term, these responsibilities are widened and affect the users-creation pools as well.\nDespite the advantages of a decentralized autonomous organization, especially in collecting the crowd’s wisdom before making a decision, this model brings the risks of being attacked or manipulated by a centralized entity, etc.\nTo be more specific, if most governance tokens are in the hand of centralized parties, it would be possible for a governance attack to occur where a centralized entity uses its users’ voting power to take over the governance proposals and voting.\nIn that case, it is necessary to have a group of people who can solve the problem quickly and effectively enough to prevent the worst scenario and consult reasonable strategies for avoiding the risks.\n \n**What are the primary roles of SAB?**\nAs mentioned, this group of people is responsible for the security of the Trava Governance, which is implied in some main points:\n * First, providing quick solutions for unexpected issues relating to the dramatic fluctuation of the market and hacking actions.\n * Second, recommending the strategy for improving the governance security.\n\n\n \n**Who are they?**\nGiven the crucial role of the SAB, in the beginning, this team combines experts who also take responsibility for the development of the Trava Ecosystem as a whole.\nWe would like to introduce the SAB team as below:\n * Mr. Minh Nguyen — CEO & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Duc Tran — Head of Security & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Thang Nguyen — CTO & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Quan Dinh — CPO & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Chung Dao — Strategy Advisor of Trava Finance- CEO & Co-founder Oraichain\n\n\nFirst, the security advisor board includes five people from the team, as mentioned above.

This blog post will explain why we need it, how it works and its mechanism._\nNFT Bridge is one of soon to be released features by Trava Finance\nNFTs are unique digital assets that are typically created and traded on a specific blockchain network, particularly in this case — Trava Knights. However, as NFT ecosystem expands, there is a need for interoperability between different blockchain networks to allow for seamless movement across platforms.\nIf you’ve been paying attention to our latest AMA, you might already know that Trava Finance is about to release many new features and one of which is the NFT Bridge. It will help solve this problem by enabling the transfer of Limited Knight NFTs from one blockchain to another, increasing the utility of the Knights, and opening new opportunities for creators, collectors, and users.\n \nWhy do we need the Trava NFT Bridge?\nKnight NFT is one of the outstanding unique products of Trava Finance, besides Trava Tickets, especially towards the goal of Decentralized Marketplace. Therefore, it will be a big regret if its operation and value are only encapsulated in our ecosystem as it is now.\nUsually, exchange across different blockchains without a bridge is possible, but it would be very expensive and time-consuming. That’s why Trava Finance decided to open NFT Bridge, which allows users to move their Knights between chains. By doing this, there are more chances for our products to participate in the wide-open market on the Ethereum network. This will also increase the utilization and value of Trava Knight NFTs.\nTrava NFT bridge still has some limitations, but we will definitely give it more uses in the future. For now, it can only support transfers to Ethereum and with Limited Knights:\n * Aleister — Eye of the Twelve.\n * Medivh — Ambassador of Techfian Principality.\n * Sir Kuana — Commander of TraDAO.\n * Dame Johanna — Shield of the Twelve.\n * Limited TR-A Valor-1.\n\n\n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains. The transition happens on the bridge seamlessly, you only need to pay a fee and follow some particular rules for it to work.\nWhen transferring, simply, your Limited Knight NFT(s) on the BSC mainnet will be locked, and the same one will be minted on Ethereum. When you want to transfer it back, the Limited Knight on Ethereum will be burned, and the locked version will be released. For more clarity on how it works, you can follow the detailed mechanism explanations below:\n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains. The transition happens on the bridge seamlessly, you only need to pay a fee and follow some particular rules for it to work.\nWhen transferring, simply, your Limited Knight NFT(s) on the BSC mainnet will be locked, and the same one will be minted on Ethereum. When you want to transfer it back, the Limited Knight on Ethereum will be burned, and the locked version will be released. For more clarity on how it works, you can follow the detailed mechanism explanations below:\n\nTransfer your Limited Knight NFT(s) from Source Chain to Destination Chain\nAfter starting this process, you will have to connect to the wallet that has the Knight NFT that you want to transfer, note that currently this bridge only supports Unique Collection. The transfer then goes through a verification process, which includes checking if the sender (you) is the owner of the NFT collection and has sent the required bridge fee.\nWhen those things are finished, your transfer will be processed and the bridge will lock your Limited Knight NFT, then retrieve all the necessary information about you and your assets. It then is encoded into a message, which will be sent by the MainBridge to a queue serving as a way to track transactions and handle any potential issues, such as missed events or system failures.\nUpon receiving the message, the Bridge checks its validity and emits an event containing the bridge data, which is then captured and verified by a Relayer. If the bridge data is deemed valid, the Relayer will sign the bridge data and send it back to you along with the signature, allowing the transfer process. Your Limited Knight NFT will be locked from this moment onward, and you won’t be able to access it from the Source Chain (BNB chain).\nThen, to get your NFT from the Destination Chain, you will have to prove it using the information received. It’s only usable once and remains valid for 2 months from the time of signing, and anyone can utilize it. However, the Limited Knight will be minted just for the person whose address has been specified. If everything is valid and the data has not been used before, the Bridge will mint the Limited Knight NFT for you (the intended receiver).\n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains. The transition happens on the bridge seamlessly, you only need to pay a fee and follow some particular rules for it to work.\nWhen transferring, simply, your Limited Knight NFT(s) on the BSC mainnet will be locked, and the same one will be minted on Ethereum. When you want to transfer it back, the Limited Knight on Ethereum will be burned, and the locked version will be released. For more clarity on how it works, you can follow the detailed mechanism explanations below:\n\nTransfer your Limited Knight NFT(s) from Destination Chain to Source Chain\nBasically, you will have to go through the similar process as above, only with some minor differences. The first is that after verifying specific criteria, instead of locking, the Limited Knight NFT on the Destination Chain will be burned. The process includes:\n * Verifying whether you are the rightful owner of the NFT collection.\n * Checking if it was originally bridged from the Source Chain.\n * Confirming the bridge fee is paid.\n\n\nOnce the Limited Knight NFT on Ethereum has been successfully burned, another message will be encoded just as mentioned in the previous section. You will go through a similar process, and then your Limited Knight NFt will be released from the locked state.\n**_About Trava.Finance_**\nTrava Finance is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending.\nWhile existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, Trava Finance offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.\nTrava Finance is deployed on the BSC and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks.\nWebsite | | | | Medium | | \n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains.

As in the Trava Lending pool, there are over 15 types of cryptocurrency on three chains, consisting of BSC, Fantom, and Ethereum.\nUsually, exchange across different blockchains for cryptocurrency is possible without a cross-chain bridge. However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to do so. That’s why we need a bridge that enables users to transit their tokens easier and faster at a low cost.\nFor now, Trava.finance has already opened a bridge that allows users to transfer their TRAVA tokens from Fantom to BSC and vice versa. However, given the increase of the rTRAVA utilities, we are pleased to introduce the rTRAVA bridge that helps our users to exchange rTRAVA tokens from Fantom and Ethereum to BSC.\n \n**What benefit does the rTRAVA bridge bring to the whole ecosystem?**\nAs mentioned, users can transit rTRAVA tokens from Fantom and Ethereum to BSC easier and cheaper with the rTRAVA bridge.\nBy doing that, there are more chances for them to participate in various programs on the BSC network, especially in locking their tokens in the Trava governance vault to attain voting power and rewards.\nTo be more specific, in Trava Governance, the decision-making power of users corresponds with the volume of TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB they lock in the Trava Governance vault.\nAt first, the voting power attained from locking TRAVA and rTRAVA is the same. However, there will be some differences between these two that locking rTRAVA will get more significant power in the future. Thus, locking rTRAVA seems to be a smart choice to improve the influence in the ecosystem quickly.\nNevertheless, the Trava Governance vault is implemented on the BSC platform that stops users from locking rTRAVA tokens.\nBy implementing the rTRAVA bridge, users now can effortlessly transfer rTRAVA from Ethereum and Fantom to BSC, lock them then attain both rewards and decision-making power.\nThe rTRAVA Bridge\n \n**How does it work?**\nAs mentioned, the rTRAVA bridge makes the token transition process quicker and effortless. When transit your rTRAVA tokens through the bridge, you only need to pay a small amount of bridge fee and follow some particular rules.\nTwo options relating to the parameters of the rTRAVA bridge are shown in the table below. Thus, a voting snapshot will soon be opened for our community to choose which one should be officially applied.\n 1. _Delay time_**:** The period you need to wait for implementing the transaction.\n 2. _Bridge Fee_ : The fee (in TRAVA) you need to pay for each transaction using the rTRAVA bridge.\n\n\n**_Examples for calculating the bridge fee:_**"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-the-rtrava-bridge-678b349767ae?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----62-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""**How to participate in Governance?**\nTrava users need to lock their Trava/rTrava for veTRAVA token to participate in the on-chain governance process.

This blog post will explain why we need it, how it works and its mechanism._\nNFT Bridge is one of soon to be released features by Trava Finance\nNFTs are unique digital assets that are typically created and traded on a specific blockchain network, particularly in this case — Trava Knights. However, as NFT ecosystem expands, there is a need for interoperability between different blockchain networks to allow for seamless movement across platforms.\nIf you’ve been paying attention to our latest AMA, you might already know that Trava Finance is about to release many new features and one of which is the NFT Bridge. It will help solve this problem by enabling the transfer of Limited Knight NFTs from one blockchain to another, increasing the utility of the Knights, and opening new opportunities for creators, collectors, and users.\n \nWhy do we need the Trava NFT Bridge?\nKnight NFT is one of the outstanding unique products of Trava Finance, besides Trava Tickets, especially towards the goal of Decentralized Marketplace. Therefore, it will be a big regret if its operation and value are only encapsulated in our ecosystem as it is now.\nUsually, exchange across different blockchains without a bridge is possible, but it would be very expensive and time-consuming. That’s why Trava Finance decided to open NFT Bridge, which allows users to move their Knights between chains. By doing this, there are more chances for our products to participate in the wide-open market on the Ethereum network. This will also increase the utilization and value of Trava Knight NFTs.\nTrava NFT bridge still has some limitations, but we will definitely give it more uses in the future. For now, it can only support transfers to Ethereum and with Limited Knights:\n * Aleister — Eye of the Twelve.\n * Medivh — Ambassador of Techfian Principality.\n * Sir Kuana — Commander of TraDAO.\n * Dame Johanna — Shield of the Twelve.\n * Limited TR-A Valor-1.\n\n\n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains. The transition happens on the bridge seamlessly, you only need to pay a fee and follow some particular rules for it to work.\nWhen transferring, simply, your Limited Knight NFT(s) on the BSC mainnet will be locked, and the same one will be minted on Ethereum. When you want to transfer it back, the Limited Knight on Ethereum will be burned, and the locked version will be released. For more clarity on how it works, you can follow the detailed mechanism explanations below:\n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains. The transition happens on the bridge seamlessly, you only need to pay a fee and follow some particular rules for it to work.\nWhen transferring, simply, your Limited Knight NFT(s) on the BSC mainnet will be locked, and the same one will be minted on Ethereum. When you want to transfer it back, the Limited Knight on Ethereum will be burned, and the locked version will be released. For more clarity on how it works, you can follow the detailed mechanism explanations below:\n\nTransfer your Limited Knight NFT(s) from Source Chain to Destination Chain\nAfter starting this process, you will have to connect to the wallet that has the Knight NFT that you want to transfer, note that currently this bridge only supports Unique Collection. The transfer then goes through a verification process, which includes checking if the sender (you) is the owner of the NFT collection and has sent the required bridge fee.\nWhen those things are finished, your transfer will be processed and the bridge will lock your Limited Knight NFT, then retrieve all the necessary information about you and your assets. It then is encoded into a message, which will be sent by the MainBridge to a queue serving as a way to track transactions and handle any potential issues, such as missed events or system failures.\nUpon receiving the message, the Bridge checks its validity and emits an event containing the bridge data, which is then captured and verified by a Relayer. If the bridge data is deemed valid, the Relayer will sign the bridge data and send it back to you along with the signature, allowing the transfer process. Your Limited Knight NFT will be locked from this moment onward, and you won’t be able to access it from the Source Chain (BNB chain).\nThen, to get your NFT from the Destination Chain, you will have to prove it using the information received. It’s only usable once and remains valid for 2 months from the time of signing, and anyone can utilize it. However, the Limited Knight will be minted just for the person whose address has been specified. If everything is valid and the data has not been used before, the Bridge will mint the Limited Knight NFT for you (the intended receiver).\n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains. The transition happens on the bridge seamlessly, you only need to pay a fee and follow some particular rules for it to work.\nWhen transferring, simply, your Limited Knight NFT(s) on the BSC mainnet will be locked, and the same one will be minted on Ethereum. When you want to transfer it back, the Limited Knight on Ethereum will be burned, and the locked version will be released. For more clarity on how it works, you can follow the detailed mechanism explanations below:\n\nTransfer your Limited Knight NFT(s) from Destination Chain to Source Chain\nBasically, you will have to go through the similar process as above, only with some minor differences. The first is that after verifying specific criteria, instead of locking, the Limited Knight NFT on the Destination Chain will be burned. The process includes:\n * Verifying whether you are the rightful owner of the NFT collection.\n * Checking if it was originally bridged from the Source Chain.\n * Confirming the bridge fee is paid.\n\n\nOnce the Limited Knight NFT on Ethereum has been successfully burned, another message will be encoded just as mentioned in the previous section. You will go through a similar process, and then your Limited Knight NFt will be released from the locked state.\n**_About Trava.Finance_**\nTrava Finance is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending.\nWhile existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, Trava Finance offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.\nTrava Finance is deployed on the BSC and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks.\nWebsite | | | | Medium | | \n \nHow does it work?\nAs mentioned, the Trava NFT bridge will give you the ability to transfer your Limited Knight NFTs between BNB and Ethereum chains.

In this case, veTRAVA, in the form of NFT, represents this power and is determined by the time and amount of locked tokens (as they show your commitment toward the future of Trava Finance).\nWith the implementation of the Trava Governance Vault, users can lock their TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB into this vault to receive a certain amount of veTRAVA representing their powers: the more veTRAVA you own, the higher your voting power in the Trava ecosystem. ## The Benefits Of Owning veTRAVA\nThe key value of veTRAVA is its representative of users’ power and their commitment to the project. As a result, in the long term, users who own veTRAVA can receive significant benefits:\n * Deciding on crucial parameters such as LTV, risk parameters, etc., in the lending pools (Trava Lending Pool and Users-owned Pools).\n * Receiving share profit coming from the fee charged by borrowers\n * Receiving boosting rewards **in rTRAVA** by providing liquidity and holding veTRAVA at the same time.\n * Earning TRAVA reward: the APR will be revealed soon.\n\n\nAs mentioned, veTRAVA is utilized as a form of NFT. For now, it can only be available for those who lock their token into the Governance Vault. However, it will be exchanged peer-to-peer with the launch of veTRAVA Marketplace. # veTRAVA Marketplace: Overview\nAs its name suggests, the veTRAVA marketplace is for users to buy and sell their veTRAVA. It means they can freely exchange their voting power. The main reason we came up with this idea is to optimize users’ experience, bringing them as much freedom as possible. It’s the “Decentralization” we are heading for.\nBesides bringing more freedom to users, veTRAVA Marketplace increases liquidity for veTRAVA and thus benefits both sellers and buyers. In more detail, buyers can buy veTRAVA (voting power) easily on Marketplace and then earn voting power immediately. In this case, the remaining locking time will be more flexible, no longer limited to a particular period set in the Governance Vault. When it comes to sellers, they can easily utilize crypto assets in a more liberal way and get benefits from it. ## The Influences of veTRAVA Marketplace\nveTRAVA Marketplace is an important feature that contributes to the development of Trava Governance. As mentioned above, users who hold many veTRAVA will have a crucial role in the decision-making process of the Trava Finance ecosystem. The veTRAVA holders can alternate the voting results, and through the Marketplace, users can buy or sell the voting power with others.\nWith the fact that users can trade their voting power to each other, anyone in the ecosystem will have a chance to vote for the changes they want to make in Trava Finance. The more users have veTRAVA, the more voting power is distributed, and users will be given the full power to make the decisions that can affect the Decentralized Lending Marketplace, which will elevate the decentralized side of Trava Finance’s ultimate goal."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-vetrava-marketplace-c9092a0c51c8"", ""rrf_score"": 0.08333333333333333 }, { ""content"": ""## Introduction Alpha Version of Trava Token Health\n ### What is Token Health?\nAug 26, 2021\nAug 26, 2021"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/?source=post_page---byline--63d315146b69---------------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""##\n**Introduction to Vote Locking mechanism**\nTrava & rTrava holders can vote-lock their tokens into the Trava Governance to receive veTRAVA, which holds voting power.

The event was hosted by Ms. Tilly, Community Mod, and covered 3 main sections:\n1️⃣ Information about TravaGPT V3.0.\n2️⃣ The ongoing incentive program for TravaGPT.\n3️⃣ Answers community questions.\nLet’s go through the discussions in this AMA event in this article.\n \nInformation about TravaGPT V3.0\n**First Question: We can see that Trava Finance is increasingly pushing AI chatbot — TravaGPT. So can you introduce this product to new users and explain its significance in Trava ecosystem to everyone, please?**\nFor those who are new here, TravaGPT is an AI chatbot that helps enhance user experience and lets you navigate DeFi more easily. This product has been launched in Trava Finance since the beginning of 2024, and as of now, it has developed almost completely.\nAs the world is focusing on AI technology to unlock more potential benefits, Trava Finance also looks ahead to apply advanced technology in our product to provide an unlimited user experience. TravaGPT is born with the mission to become a personal assistant in blockchain investment in Trava ecosystem.\nThat means, you just need to ask TravaGPT to do everything in our ecosystem. The flow will be streamlined from users -> TravaGPT -> Trava Finance.\n**Second Question: TravaGPT has undergone many major upgrades to reach the current version V3.0. So what is special about TravaGPT V3.0?**\nWell, TravaGPT has entered Version V3.0, which integrates with Smart Wallet and automates popular actions on Trava Finance.\nAt present, you can ask TravaGPT to do actions in Trava Finance with Smart Wallets as follows:\n➡️ Lending Pools: Deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw.\n➡️ Trava Staking: Stake, withdraw, claim reward.\n➡️ Trava governance: Create lock, increase amount, increase unlock time, withdraw, merge, compound.\nWhen you try this version, you can see significant improvement in experience:\n✅ Provides real-time information for tokens, defi applications\n✅ Easily execute transactions within Trava ecosystem by natural language, saving time since users don’t need to go through each application to execute the corresponding transactions\nEspecially, we have updated a mini assistant in TravaGPT to help quick transfer between your wallet and smart wallet.\n👉 So don’t forget to give it a try: https://app.trava.finance/gpt\n**Third Question: I think that many users are waiting for more improvement and benefits of TravaGPT. So do you have any plans for future development of TravaGPT?**\nIn the future, we’ll come up with advanced features for TravaGPT:\n👉 Collect and analyze real-time news in the blockchain industry to provide deeper insights\n👉 Customize recommendations using the user’s assets for a personalized experience\nEverything is waiting ahead, so stay tuned with us for a greater experience!\n \nThe ongoing incentive program for TravaGPT\n**Fourth Question: Currently, Trava is running an incentive program for TravaGPT V3.0. Could you please share with us the objective for this campaign?**\nThe official name of TravaGPT V3.0’s incentive program is “Easy Integration, Abundant Rewards”\nThis campaign plays an important role in perfecting TravaGPT. It aims to help users get used to the new updates of our chatbot and provide them with real benefits.\nAfter the campaign, we hope that Trava users will adopt a handy way of using Trava products: ⚡** _ask TravaGPT to do actions in Trava Finance_** ⚡\n**Fifth Question: So how can we participate in this campaign and are there any notices to keep in mind?**\nTo join TravaGPT V3.0’s incentive campaign, you need to have 2 things:\n**_1. TravaGPT using permission_**\nAnyone who holds $5 Trava/vTrava/rTrava/staked Trava/staked rTrava can use TravaGPT: https://app.trava.finance/gpt\n** _2. A Smart Wallet:_**\nCreate your smart wallet here if you haven’t had it yet: https://app.trava.finance/station\nNext, you just need to do a simple thing:\n**_asking TravaGPT_** _to deposit/ stake with_** _Smart Wallet_** _in Trava Finance lending pool/ Trava Staking and Trava Finance._\n⚠️ Especially, remember to ensure this NOTE:\nWhen you stake/ deposit in Trava pools/vaults, you’ll have your own APR reward and PLUS 20% of the APR. HOWEVER:\n✅ Leaving the reward in the vault until the campaign ends, you will earn an extra 20% APR.\n❌ Withdrawing the reward before the campaign ends, you will NOT receive that extra 20% APR.\n**Sixth Question: Many users are still confused a little bit about the Rewards of the campaign, especially the 20% APR PLUS. Could you give us a clear explanation for those rewards?**\nThe 20% APR PUS means that you will have an additional 20% of the APR you have when depositing/staking in Trava pool/vault.\nTo make things simple, I will give you the formula for this reward:\n**_APR + (20% * APR)_**\nFor example, when you stake tokens in Trava Staking and have 4.5% APR. In this campaign, you will not only have that 4.5% APR but also an additional 20% of that APR, which is 0.9%\nRemember that you also have Extra Rewards and Lottery Rewards, alongside the 20% APR PLUS.\n👉 So let’s join us and get yourself in this LEADERBOARD:\n \nAnswers community questions\nThe AMA also provided insightful answers to the community’s questions on Twitter and during the event on Telegram."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/ama-recap-unlock-travagpt-v3-0s-incentive-campaign-9607162f1da5?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----5-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.0625 }, { ""content"": ""Trava’s incentive programs aim to encourage users who show significant commitment to the protocol's future.\nveTRAVA holders will start to earn rewards in TRAVA tokens after they lock their tokens in the Trava Governance vault.

That’s why we need a bridge that enables users to transit their tokens easier and faster at a low cost.\nFor now, Trava.finance has already opened a bridge that allows users to transfer their TRAVA tokens from Fantom to BSC and vice versa. However, given the increase of the rTRAVA utilities, we are pleased to introduce the rTRAVA bridge that helps our users to exchange rTRAVA tokens from Fantom and Ethereum to BSC.\n \n**What benefit does the rTRAVA bridge bring to the whole ecosystem?**\nAs mentioned, users can transit rTRAVA tokens from Fantom and Ethereum to BSC easier and cheaper with the rTRAVA bridge.\nBy doing that, there are more chances for them to participate in various programs on the BSC network, especially in locking their tokens in the Trava governance vault to attain voting power and rewards.\nTo be more specific, in Trava Governance, the decision-making power of users corresponds with the volume of TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB they lock in the Trava Governance vault.\nAt first, the voting power attained from locking TRAVA and rTRAVA is the same. However, there will be some differences between these two that locking rTRAVA will get more significant power in the future. Thus, locking rTRAVA seems to be a smart choice to improve the influence in the ecosystem quickly.\nNevertheless, the Trava Governance vault is implemented on the BSC platform that stops users from locking rTRAVA tokens.\nBy implementing the rTRAVA bridge, users now can effortlessly transfer rTRAVA from Ethereum and Fantom to BSC, lock them then attain both rewards and decision-making power.\nThe rTRAVA Bridge\n \n**How does it work?**\nAs mentioned, the rTRAVA bridge makes the token transition process quicker and effortless. When transit your rTRAVA tokens through the bridge, you only need to pay a small amount of bridge fee and follow some particular rules.\nTwo options relating to the parameters of the rTRAVA bridge are shown in the table below. Thus, a voting snapshot will soon be opened for our community to choose which one should be officially applied.\n 1. _Delay time_**:** The period you need to wait for implementing the transaction.\n 2. _Bridge Fee_ : The fee (in TRAVA) you need to pay for each transaction using the rTRAVA bridge.\n\n\n**_Examples for calculating the bridge fee:_**"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-the-rtrava-bridge-678b349767ae?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----62-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""M\n**Merge veTRAVA** A function that allows users to merge two veTRAVANFTs together while preserving voting power and reward.

The event was hosted by Ms. Tilly, Community Mod, and covered 3 main sections:\n1️⃣ Information about TravaGPT V3.0.\n2️⃣ The ongoing incentive program for TravaGPT.\n3️⃣ Answers community questions.\nLet’s go through the discussions in this AMA event in this article.\n \nInformation about TravaGPT V3.0\n**First Question: We can see that Trava Finance is increasingly pushing AI chatbot — TravaGPT. So can you introduce this product to new users and explain its significance in Trava ecosystem to everyone, please?**\nFor those who are new here, TravaGPT is an AI chatbot that helps enhance user experience and lets you navigate DeFi more easily. This product has been launched in Trava Finance since the beginning of 2024, and as of now, it has developed almost completely.\nAs the world is focusing on AI technology to unlock more potential benefits, Trava Finance also looks ahead to apply advanced technology in our product to provide an unlimited user experience. TravaGPT is born with the mission to become a personal assistant in blockchain investment in Trava ecosystem.\nThat means, you just need to ask TravaGPT to do everything in our ecosystem. The flow will be streamlined from users -> TravaGPT -> Trava Finance.\n**Second Question: TravaGPT has undergone many major upgrades to reach the current version V3.0. So what is special about TravaGPT V3.0?**\nWell, TravaGPT has entered Version V3.0, which integrates with Smart Wallet and automates popular actions on Trava Finance.\nAt present, you can ask TravaGPT to do actions in Trava Finance with Smart Wallets as follows:\n➡️ Lending Pools: Deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw.\n➡️ Trava Staking: Stake, withdraw, claim reward.\n➡️ Trava governance: Create lock, increase amount, increase unlock time, withdraw, merge, compound.\nWhen you try this version, you can see significant improvement in experience:\n✅ Provides real-time information for tokens, defi applications\n✅ Easily execute transactions within Trava ecosystem by natural language, saving time since users don’t need to go through each application to execute the corresponding transactions\nEspecially, we have updated a mini assistant in TravaGPT to help quick transfer between your wallet and smart wallet.\n👉 So don’t forget to give it a try: https://app.trava.finance/gpt\n**Third Question: I think that many users are waiting for more improvement and benefits of TravaGPT. So do you have any plans for future development of TravaGPT?**\nIn the future, we’ll come up with advanced features for TravaGPT:\n👉 Collect and analyze real-time news in the blockchain industry to provide deeper insights\n👉 Customize recommendations using the user’s assets for a personalized experience\nEverything is waiting ahead, so stay tuned with us for a greater experience!\n \nThe ongoing incentive program for TravaGPT\n**Fourth Question: Currently, Trava is running an incentive program for TravaGPT V3.0. Could you please share with us the objective for this campaign?**\nThe official name of TravaGPT V3.0’s incentive program is “Easy Integration, Abundant Rewards”\nThis campaign plays an important role in perfecting TravaGPT. It aims to help users get used to the new updates of our chatbot and provide them with real benefits.\nAfter the campaign, we hope that Trava users will adopt a handy way of using Trava products: ⚡** _ask TravaGPT to do actions in Trava Finance_** ⚡\n**Fifth Question: So how can we participate in this campaign and are there any notices to keep in mind?**\nTo join TravaGPT V3.0’s incentive campaign, you need to have 2 things:\n**_1. TravaGPT using permission_**\nAnyone who holds $5 Trava/vTrava/rTrava/staked Trava/staked rTrava can use TravaGPT: https://app.trava.finance/gpt\n** _2. A Smart Wallet:_**\nCreate your smart wallet here if you haven’t had it yet: https://app.trava.finance/station\nNext, you just need to do a simple thing:\n**_asking TravaGPT_** _to deposit/ stake with_** _Smart Wallet_** _in Trava Finance lending pool/ Trava Staking and Trava Finance._\n⚠️ Especially, remember to ensure this NOTE:\nWhen you stake/ deposit in Trava pools/vaults, you’ll have your own APR reward and PLUS 20% of the APR. HOWEVER:\n✅ Leaving the reward in the vault until the campaign ends, you will earn an extra 20% APR.\n❌ Withdrawing the reward before the campaign ends, you will NOT receive that extra 20% APR.\n**Sixth Question: Many users are still confused a little bit about the Rewards of the campaign, especially the 20% APR PLUS. Could you give us a clear explanation for those rewards?**\nThe 20% APR PUS means that you will have an additional 20% of the APR you have when depositing/staking in Trava pool/vault.\nTo make things simple, I will give you the formula for this reward:\n**_APR + (20% * APR)_**\nFor example, when you stake tokens in Trava Staking and have 4.5% APR. In this campaign, you will not only have that 4.5% APR but also an additional 20% of that APR, which is 0.9%\nRemember that you also have Extra Rewards and Lottery Rewards, alongside the 20% APR PLUS.\n👉 So let’s join us and get yourself in this LEADERBOARD:\n \nAnswers community questions\nThe AMA also provided insightful answers to the community’s questions on Twitter and during the event on Telegram."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/ama-recap-unlock-travagpt-v3-0s-incentive-campaign-9607162f1da5?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----5-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.0625 }, { ""content"": ""Trava’s incentive programs aim to encourage users who show significant commitment to the protocol's future.\nveTRAVA holders will start to earn rewards in TRAVA tokens after they lock their tokens in the Trava Governance vault.

It is an ERC721 token that acts as evidence of your locking token in the governance module. Every time users create a new lock, they receive a veTRAVA token, storing their locked balance, unlock time, and rewards amount.\nThe longer you lock your tokens, the more voting power you have (and the bigger incentive you can earn).

There will be proposals to enable sharing fees from protocol or boost rewards in the lending pool in the near future to enrich the veTRAVA incentive program.\n \n\n**Why do we need veTRAVA?**\nFirstly, veTRAVA represents the vote locking mechanism, which helps the protocol focus on encouraging ones who show strong commitment.\nSecondly, veTRAVA is designed as an ERC721 token, which opens a future secondary marketplace to avoid the decrease of liquidity on the market because of locking the Trava token.\n \n\n**How can I get veTRAVA?**\nYou can go to our Locker UI in Governance Portal to create a new veTRAVA lock.\nHere is the link to our user guide.\nPreviousDAONextVoting\nLast updated 2 years ago"",

There will be proposals to enable sharing fees from protocol or boost rewards in the lending pool in the near future to enrich the veTRAVA incentive program.\n \n\n**Why do we need veTRAVA?**\nFirstly, veTRAVA represents the vote locking mechanism, which helps the protocol focus on encouraging ones who show strong commitment.\nSecondly, veTRAVA is designed as an ERC721 token, which opens a future secondary marketplace to avoid the decrease of liquidity on the market because of locking the Trava token.\n \n\n**How can I get veTRAVA?**\nYou can go to our Locker UI in Governance Portal to create a new veTRAVA lock.\nHere is the link to our user guide.\nPreviousDAONextVoting\nLast updated 2 years ago"",

      ""content"": ""**Introduction To The rTRAVA Bridge**\nPublished in\n3 min readMay 21, 2022\nShare\nIntroduction To The rTRAVA Bridge\n \n** _What is the rTRAVA Bridge, and why do we need it?_**\nThere are many blockchain networks and cryptocurrencies that use different blockchain technologies. As in the Trava Lending pool, there are over 15 types of cryptocurrency on three chains, consisting of BSC, Fantom, and Ethereum.\nUsually, exchange across different blockchains for cryptocurrency is possible without a cross-chain bridge. However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to do so. That’s why we need a bridge that enables users to transit their tokens easier and faster at a low cost.\nFor now, Trava.finance has already opened a bridge that allows users to transfer their TRAVA tokens from Fantom to BSC and vice versa. However, given the increase of the rTRAVA utilities, we are pleased to introduce the rTRAVA bridge that helps our users to exchange rTRAVA tokens from Fantom and Ethereum to BSC.\n \n**What benefit does the rTRAVA bridge bring to the whole ecosystem?**\nAs mentioned, users can transit rTRAVA tokens from Fantom and Ethereum to BSC easier and cheaper with the rTRAVA bridge.\nBy doing that, there are more chances for them to participate in various programs on the BSC network, especially in locking their tokens in the Trava governance vault to attain voting power and rewards.\nTo be more specific, in Trava Governance, the decision-making power of users corresponds with the volume of TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB they lock in the Trava Governance vault.\nAt first, the voting power attained from locking TRAVA and rTRAVA is the same. However, there will be some differences between these two that locking rTRAVA will get more significant power in the future. Thus, locking rTRAVA seems to be a smart choice to improve the influence in the ecosystem quickly.\nNevertheless, the Trava Governance vault is implemented on the BSC platform that stops users from locking rTRAVA tokens.\nBy implementing the rTRAVA bridge, users now can effortlessly transfer rTRAVA from Ethereum and Fantom to BSC, lock them then attain both rewards and decision-making power.\nThe rTRAVA Bridge\n \n**How does it work?**\nAs mentioned, the rTRAVA bridge makes the token transition process quicker and effortless. When transit your rTRAVA tokens through the bridge, you only need to pay a small amount of bridge fee and follow some particular rules.\nTwo options relating to the parameters of the rTRAVA bridge are shown in the table below. Thus, a voting snapshot will soon be opened for our community to choose which one should be officially applied.\n  1. _Delay time_**:** The period you need to wait for implementing the transaction.\n  2. _Bridge Fee_ : The fee (in TRAVA) you need to pay for each transaction using the rTRAVA bridge.\n\n\n**_Examples for calculating the bridge fee:_**"",

With the presence of Dr. Minh, CEO of Trava Finance, Mr. Thang, CTO of Trava Finance, Ms. Quinn, Marketing Lead of Trava Finance and Ms. Michelle — BD of TechFi, this meetup is a major element of the introduction of Trava’s new phase and a new connection with TechFi, an educational website about crypto and blockchain for investors and developers. The meetup is going to reveal a potential connection in the future between the 2 projects.\nThe meet-up was divided into 3 parts: (1) Greeting and Introduction, (2) In-depth Discussion, and (3) Ending.\nIn this Recap, we will try to summarize the most interesting points for you.\n \n**Part 1: Greeting and Introduction**\n**Ms. Quinn**\nGood afternoon ladies and gentlemen. My name is Quinn, Marketing Lead at TRAVA.finance. It’s my pleasure to welcome you here today.\nGuys, I am very very excited right now. As all of u know even though there are already 3 meetup episodes, this is the 1st time we have a livestream ever in our community\nJoining us today, I’m glad to introduce Dr. Minh and Mr. Thang, our CEO and CTO who are co-founders of Trava Finance. They will walk us through some main points as short-term goals of Trava and the next actions in terms of technology, marketing, and business development plan in this bearish market situation. I’m also super excited because today we got here a secret guest who will be speaking at the last part of the meetup.\nThere are totally three parts today: Give a brief view at first, then go to detailed information on the Development Plan of Trava Finance. And the last one — I bet u guys will be curious about the guest and listen to sharings about marketing development.\nHi Minh. Hi Thang. How are you doing?\n**Dr. Minh**\nHi Quinn, I’m doing great. Really nice to be here with our community and have a close conversation with you guys, especially in the situation that we’re going through all the uncertainties and insecurities appearing recently in the world of cryptocurrency.\n**Mr. Thang**\nHi, Quinn. Hi everybody. I’m good, I hope you’re doing well. To be honest, I’ve been a bit busy lately, have been researching and digging deep into the market lately. So it’s really great to sit together and talk with you guys and then walk you through all of the plans we are heading towards. And excited to talk to our guests at the same time.\n**Ms. Quinn**\nGreat! Seems that we are all ready for the discussion with our Knights today.\n \n**Part 2: In-depth Discussion**\n \n**Part 2: In-depth Discussion**\n\nTopic1: Development plan overview in Tech and Marketing\n**Ms. Quinn**\nSo, as you know, the market situation seems to be rather red and not good for many projects and investors as well. Many investors are panicked since they can not handle the situation, and some start to sell, creating great selling pressure. As the CEO, Minh, can u share to our Knights your strategies to maintain the growth of the project and keep the trust among the community?\n**Dr. Minh**\nIt’s really hard to say what is right to do at that time in this bear market. So I have been listening to the feedback from our community, observing the market, and consulting a lot of individuals who are experienced in cryptocurrency.\nIn fact, we still try to stick with the initial ideas that follow our long-term vision. At the same time, we also have some modifications to adapt to the bear market at the moment, including some new ideas about technology, marketing, and business.\n \n**Part 2: In-depth Discussion**\n\nTopic 2: Technology development plan\n**Ms. Quinn**\nGreat! Talk about the technology development, could you please give users some detailed information\n**Dr. Minh**\nActually, we are trying to stick with our long-term vision, but at the same time having some modifications to adapt to the current market.\nMore specifically, as you know, in the long run, Trava will be the first protocol allowing users to create their own lending pool and build a total decentralized marketplace. We still try to stick with this idea and gradually provide users with unique features related to NFT-collateralization, cross-chain, and data analysis. Et cetera.\nAt the same time, we also have some modifications to handle the bear market at the moment. We will focus on some main products that actually meet the user’s needs and prioritize creating a thorough information workflow that ensures the community has the needed information. I believe it is an effective way to build trust and engagement in the ecosystem.\nFor detailed information, I suppose we should listen to Thang.\n**Mr. Thang**\nAbsolutely right, Dr. Minh. It’s better to focus on something that actually works and benefits our users, both old and new ones.\nActually, allowing users to create their own lending pool is our long-term vision. We saw its potential and benefit at first and still believe in its critical role in the ecosystem. In addition, in the future, we also seek to build a decentralized marketplace that users have fully responsible for.\nIt’s a long way to go. Actually, we are gradually reaching this goal by generating the Trava Governance. You know, a forum and then a locked vault was released, and the Trava Governance will be officially live on 19th May, prepare for it, guys. Moreover, on the way to reaching these goals, we bring users benefits with our unique products. They are about the cross-chain transition, NFT collateralization, and data analysis.\nOne more thing, I bet most people know that the Trava Ecosystem now includes Trava NFT, TraDAO, and Trava lending pool. The three of them have a close relationship, and all together, they enrich our ecosystem day by day.\n**Ms. Quinn**\nThat’s a strong relationship between Lending Pool and NFT. So what’s about Lending Pool and TraDAO. Is it a closed relationship?\nTrava Ecosystem\n**Mr. Thang**\nTalking about the connection between the Lending pool and TraDAO, we have already calculated the reputation of users in the whole Trava ecosystem, starting with wallet reputation to TRAVA token. Users with high TRAVA and TOD reputations might be of benefit when joining the Investment Committee. The Investment Committee might use our new feature, which will be introduced very soon in the future. And after that, the committee can make the decision to invest the Treasury in the projects that brings the most profit, which can be Trava Lending Pool.\n**Dr. Minh**\nSeems that the new feature is a useful tool for the TraDAO community to decide on their investment, we are looking forward to it. Can you give us the detail of the relationship between TraDAO and Trava Knight NFT?\n**Mr. Thang**\nOur new feature is indeed worth waiting for. About TraDAO and Knight NFT, as in the infographic, Investment Committee can mint veTOD, which acts as an NFT. Like veTRAVA, users can buy, sell and auction veTOD on the NFT marketplace. The auctioned veTOD might be used as collateral in Trava Lending Pool. The details of how the Investment Committee can mint veTOD will be announced very soon in the future. So, stay tuned for much excitement ahead.\n \n**Part 2: In-depth Discussion**\n\nTopic 3: Marketing development plan\n**Mr. Thang**\nPersonally, I think it’s reasonable when we focus on improving the quality of current features, as well as the communication and understanding among the community. So, Dr. Minh, let’s talk about our marketing and business development plan.\n**Dr. Minh**\nAbout Marketing, we have the orientation of growing organic Marketing. We try to organize internal events to improve the communication between the team and our community. These internal events are expected to update our community on what we are doing right now and to enhance trust among our community in this bearish sentiment.\nLast but not least, for Business, we also seek in-depth partnerships. On the foundation of the partnerships, we hope to attract more new users to our community. And as you know, this meetup will reveal the future partnership between us and TechFi, a website providing investors and developers with a strong foundation of technology in the cryptocurrency space. I hope this future partnership will be a win-win relationship, TechFi can help us attract users, and we can help TechFi in contributing informative articles or statistics.\n**Mr. Thang**\nReally insightful indeed! Can you outline the next specific actions for Marketing?\n**Dr. Minh**\nA lot is worth waiting ahead, Thang. I think I told enough about our brief vision, so now, with specific actions in Marketing, Ms.Quinn, I bet you will be really really ready to share?\n**Ms. Quinn**\nWell sure.\nMaybe many u guys here know that there are 3 main types of media funnels that are really important in digital marketing: owned (our social channels, website, or all the media we created, paid (like KOLs, influencers or ads on Twitter, gg search PPC…) and earned media (Feedback from users themselves or we can say the worth of mouth and the organic effect from the partnership). Reach a diverse audience through Paid Media, create engaging, customer-driven content and solve their problems on Owned Media, then encourage them to share, rate, or support the brand that is earned media.\nWith the current situation and based on our strategies, we will focus on owned media and earned media at the moment. Focus on the community power right now and discuss more with experts from outside of the team (Like today we have micelle here today). So, for now, it’s necessary to strengthen the communication activities in our community. We will be organizing internal actions, like meetups, community calls, user guide calls, etc., with the live version via Telegram, Discord, or Twitter Space, in order to create more opportunities for our users to directly talk to the product owners of Trava. All in all, we want to focus on customer services and loyal knights. The key or the atom of Trava is technology is the real team with a clear vision no matter how subjective factors, and we will always educate users about that. Thanks guys for always being here and realizing those points and always cheering us.\nWe hope that with these events, our community will get the latest update on what the team is doing, and we will build a better understanding between team and community through real conversation. I believe communication between team and community is of utmost importance in marketing strategy in this bearish moment.\n**Dr. Minh**\nVery nice Quinn, specific actions with a clear purpose.\n**Mr. Thang**\nIndeed. Apart from these internal events, are there any other events with other projects?\n**Ms. Quinn**\nNice question Thang, I’m about to talk about the potential partnership between Trava and TechFi. As Dr. Minh mentioned, we will soon collaborate with TechFi, an educational blog targeting people who are interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.\nActually, today, we invite a special guest, Ms. Michelle from TechFi, who will give you more detailed information about this blog and about the supportive relationship between the two of us.\nHi Michelle, I hope you’re doing well.\n \n**Part 2: In-depth Discussion**\n\nTopic 4: Business development plan — Partnership with TechFi\n**Ms. Michelle**\nHi Quinn, Hi everyone. I’m Michelle from TechFi. It’s such an honor to be here today with you guys and talk about our blog as well as the way to improve the marketing performance of both Trava and TechFi.\nJust like Dr. Minh and Mr. Thang have mentioned, the market now is not really good. The investors are losing their trust in some way. That’s why we need a wise vision, quick action, and reasonable solutions for the existing problems. It’s great to hear that you guys are doing well and have a clear vision.\n**Ms. Quinn**\nYes. For those who may not know about TechFi could you please give us some information about your blog?\n**Ms. Michelle**\nYeah. TechFi is an educational blog for those who care about the world of blockchain. I mean, the investors and developers as well.\nTo be more specific, we cover a lot of areas related to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. On our website, you will find this information in the form of news, long-form articles, and personal blogs. So many choices, I would say.\nWe mainly focus on deep analysis of blockchain projects and blockchain attack cases. By doing that, we provide readers with profound insights into this exciting world which help investors make the right decision and help the developers improve their careers.\n**Dr. Minh**\nThank you, Michelle. Actually, I suppose the form of educational blogs is quite common now, and there are several websites out there following this concept. So what differentiates TechFi from others?\n**Ms. Michelle**\nAs I just said, there are two main points we want to focus on, which are the deep analysis of different projects and attack cases. They are our unique selling points, actually.\nFor now, not many websites provide readers with a deep understanding of these attacks. But with TechFi, each of them will be described and analyzed thoroughly.\nNot only investors who care about their money safety but also developers who are working in the field of blockchain security will be interested in these topics.\n**Mr. Thang**\nIt sounds interesting, you know, people tend to think that the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency is full of risks, especially when the blockchain attack happens almost every day around the world. So I think the idea of bringing a better understanding of these attacks is incredible. People are fearful of something mainly because they don’t know about it, so if they know why, how these attacks happen, how to prevent them, and how to handle the bad situation, they may put their trust in the world of cryptocurrency.\n**Ms. Michelle**\nExactly! By giving users such useful information like that, we hope to gain their trust from them thus building a strong and loyal community.\n \n**Part 3: Ending**\n**Ms. Quinn**\nYeah! Thank you Dr. Minh, Mr. Thang and Michelle.\nLadies and gentlemen, I hope that through this close conversation today, you have gained useful information about the next steps of Trava Finance as well as TechFi.\nIn this bear market, I have to say. It’s quite hard to not be affected by negative feelings. However, we have been through several struggles since the beginning of the cryptocurrency wave. That’s why we have a reason to look at the bright sight. In the last words, thank you all for being here today. See you in the next episode.\n**Dr. Minh**\nThank you, hope this meet-up gives the community a better understanding of Trava and our development vision.\n**Mr. Thang**\nMy pleasure to be here today.

The larger amount and the longer time they lock, the more voting power they will possess, and the more attractive their rewards will be. ##\n**Warm-up Rewards**\nFor users who lock their tokens after the Tuesday checkpoint, their weekly rewards will start from next week’s checkpoint, and they will receive other types of rewards from a warm-up vault instead until the next Tuesday. So don’t worry about which day it is. You will receive incentives right after locking in the Governance vault.\nThe APR used for calculating the warm-up rewards is 15% ##\n**Adaptive rewarding mechanism**\nAnd to help stabilize the rewards APR as well as bring more benefits to users, the incentive program for each week might have differences, both for the weekly rewards and the warm-up rewards.

Establishing the development of Trava DAO ensures Trava’s team mission:\n * A self-governed protocol, powered by the strength of the Trava community & secured smart contracts.\n * The growth of Trava Ecosystem, a decentralized finance platform with stable and outstanding products.\n\n\nWith that mission in mind, Trava DAO will be implemented & takes over centralized processes gradually with the growth of the ecosystem. ##\n**Governance v1**\nFor version 1 of Trava Governance, we present evolution in governance processes with on-chain features enabled. ###\n**Governance Process**\nThe governance process consists of 2 continuous processes: off-chain & on-chain.\n * Off-chain process:\n\n\nIn the off-chain process, anyone in the Trava community can raise their opinions and discuss ideas of how the protocol can improve by creating **TRC - Trava Request for Comments** on the Trava Forum.\nAfter an idea is well-formed, a community member can follow our template for **TIP - Trava Improvement Proposal** and post on the forum for details feedback. We recommend off-chain voting (powered by snapshot.org) to gain exposure and rough consensus from the community to increase the chance of succeeding in the on-chain process.\nWhen a TIP gets to its final version, the **DAO Committee** is in charge of the review process and officially proposes on-chain.\n * On-chain process:\n\n\nWhen a TIP is proposed on-chain, it becomes transparent on the public blockchain; anyone possessing voting power can directly **vote for or against** this proposal.\nAfter the voting period, a TIP will be **queued and executed** by the public.\nThe **Security Advisory Board acts as a guardian** to prevent malicious actions and security exploits in this process. ###\n**Governance Authority**\nIn governance version 1, the DAO will have authority over the Trava lending protocol. The community will have to agree on any significant changes or updates through the on-chain process. ###\n**Governance Power**\nTo gain governance power, holders need to lock their Trava or rTrava token in exchange for the veTRAVA token, which holds voting power. This vote locking mechanism encourages users who show a solid commitment to the protocol with more governance power and incentive.\nPreviousIntroductionNextLocker\nLast updated 2 years ago"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/governance/dao"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07323232323232323 } ] }",True,True,True,True,FALSE,False,,,,['https://docs.trava.finance/user-guide/trava-dao-user-guide'],"['After being created on-chain, a proposal can have 8 types of statuses: Pending: signals the waiting period before voting, the community can prepare their voting power during this period.

The game is built on the well-known blockchain idea of the No-loss-rewards game, allowing participants to earn big prizes without worrying about losing their money. # **How does it work?**\n**_So how exactly does Fortune Mining work?_**\nFor more details, users first need to deposit their money into the Fortune Mining Pool. All the rewards from the total deposit will then be distributed to a certain number of lucky users. The more money they deposit, the more chances they will be chosen (based on our algorithm).\nThat means instead of distributing for all users (based on their deposit amount) as a normal lending pool, the total rewards will be spent to be one big prize for the lucky ones. # **The benefit Fortune Mining brings to players.**"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/trava-mini-game-series-94dc54b20327"", ""rrf_score"": 0.08333333333333333 }, { ""content"": ""## **_Big prize to look for_**\nWhile there is no loss to be concerned about, the winner may earn significantly more benefits than they would if they had deposited into the regular pool.\n**_For example_** , assuming that we run a Fortune Mining pool for users to deposit DAI and gain 20.000 DAI in total deposited after one week. With APY at 1.5% (that is converted to APR at about 0,92%) and APR at 4.08%, respectively, two weeks later, the total reward for the winner will be calculated as:\n**_20000*(0.92%+ 4.08%)/365*14 = 38.356 DAI._**\nThat means if you deposit 100 DAI at first and become the lucky one, you will receive about $38,356 (the interest rate at about 1000%) instead of $0,19 (the interest rate at about 5%).\nAs in the example above, the gap between the rewards you could get in a normal pool and the Fortune Mining pool is very significant. For that reason, this mini-game will be a good choice for those with small capital to try their luck and get much more money than usual. # **To sum up, what do you need to do to attain the benefits?**\n_Step 1._ Deposit your token into the Fortune Mining Pool\n _Step 2._ Waiting for a certain period (depending on each campaign)\n_Step 3_. Check the result:\n * If you are the lucky one: Congratulations, you get all the rewards from the pool\n * If you have not been lucky yet, don’t worry, you can withdraw your deposit or keep them in the pool, then try your luck in the next period.\n\n\n_Notes: We will soon run a voting snapshot for our community to decide which asset should be put in the Fortune Mining pool.

The unique feature of this mission is that even Limited Knight can join. Not only can Limited Knights join, but also they can have priority in the opportunity of getting more Tickets as rewards after finishing the Treasure Map mission.\nMoreover, as an entrance fee, Knights must have 1 Ticket of any kind to join the Treasure Map mission. But don't worry! The rewards that you receive are worth every cost. *Note: Users also have to pay a very small amount as a transaction fee.\nIn conclusion, there are two important things that users MUST HAVE to enter Treasure Map Mission: + **1 Knight**(Copper, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Crystal, and Limited Knight) + **1 Ticket**(Counter Ticket, Presale Ticket, and Incentive Ticket)\n**NOTE:** You can deploy **as many Knights as you want in the mission at the same time. ONE Knight requires ONE Ticket** to enter. A mission will last for **6 HOURS.**\n \n\n**Rewards**\nAfter finishing the Treasure Map mission, Knight will receive Tickets and EXP as a reward.

While the former is for trading with the protocol, the latter is for selling or buying peer-to-peer.\nAnother fundamental difference between these two is the price determination method. - **On Trava Counter:** The counter price increases/decreases depending on the ticket demand but will always be maintained at a minimum of $1. Besides buying tickets, users can also sell these assets to the protocol at 80% of the current counter price. _**In fact, users can benefit from buying tickets and selling them at a higher price. For example, assuming that users buy tickets at 1$, two weeks later, if the current counter price increases to $2 because of the increasing demand, they can earn profits by selling these tickets at 1,6$ (80% of $2) to the protocol. -**_**On the marketplace:** The price will be determined by the sellers and buyers themselves.\n \n\n**Introduction to Trava Ticket**\n**What is Trava Ticket?**\nA ticket in Trava Finance is an exchangeable asset that allows users to own additional perks or access to products in the Trava Ecosystem.\nThere are three types of tickets: Counter Ticket, Presale Ticket, and Incentive Ticket.

Players must have a Ticket to enter the missions in Treasure Map. By joining Treasure Map, users can have the opportunity of earning more Tickets and other rewards.\nMoreover, Ticket will boost the success rate in the Expedition feature. When a user has a Ticket, their success rate after finishing a mission in Expedition is much higher. To enter Expedition, users have to pay a small entrance fee, but the rewards are very worthy, especially now with the enhancement of owning a Ticket.\nLastly, the essential utility of Ticket is the capability of exchanging Ticket for Chest and receiving Armoury to build a full Trava Knight. With this utility, users will have chances to enter the Trava Kingdom without paying a large amount of money to buy Knights directly from the Marketplace. Furthermore, with the assembled Knights, users can join in Mission features in Trava Knight NFT, including Farming to gain rewards and EXP, joining Expedition and earn rewards, Incentive Tickets, EXP, etc.\nIn the future, Tickets will be implemented in the PvP Tournament in Trava Knight NFT.

Another utility of Ticket in Trava Lending is that users can make use of the Ticket to withdraw rewards in Governance earlier.\nMoreover, users can use Ticket to exchange for multiple transactions in Bridge, which helps the transaction process faster and more conveniently. For more details, Ticket owners will have the right to increase the number of transactions in 1 day, the maximum amount of tokens in a transaction/day, and create multiple bridge transactions at the same time…\nNFT-collateralized has always been the ultimate goal of Trava Finance.

Applied in Trava Lending:**_ By owning tickets, you can get much more benefits in Trava Lending, relating to Trava Governance, Trava Bridge, Fortune Mining Pool, and Auction as well as collateral. More specific, using tickets, you can: - Change time/balance lock in Trava Governance - Be allowed to implement multiple transactions in Trava Bridge - Borrow assets with Tickets as NFT-collateralized - Withdraw rewards in Governance earlier - Be able to put veTRAVA on the Auction/Sell/Buy program.\n_**Scenario 3. Applied in Trava Knight NFT:**_ Take a look at the diagram that shows how you can apply for Tickets in the Trava Knight NFT programs. \nTo be more specific, you can first buy tickets, then use them to exchange for chests. After opening your chests and getting armories, you can either exchange them on the NFT marketplace or continue collecting armories to assemble the Trava NFT Knight. Then, you have multiple options related to trading or to joining missions and minigames. The TRAVA and Incentive tickets you earn can be continuously used to get tickets, then repeatedly enjoy their utilities.

We will recalculate and update the price based on the price on the market, the initial price and the data analysis extracted from our NFT Marketplace.\n**Note that** with each wallet, the maximum number of Trava Knight NFT that can be deposited in**one vault** is **one** Knight NFT. For example, if you have two Trava Knight NFTs of Gold, for example, you can only stake one of them into Gold Vault to farm and earn $TRAVA rewards.\n_**With Copper, Silver and Gold Vault, if NFT owners withdraw their NFTs within 7 days, the farming rewards will decrease by 10%.**_\nKnights with a higher rarity can be deposited in vaults of a lower rarity. Continuing the example above, one of your Gold Knights can be deposited in Gold vault and the other can be deposited in either Copper vault or Silver vault and earn APR corresponding to those vaults.\nFurthermore, for Knight NFTs put in Farming vaults, we shall use the \""Polish Mechanism”. After depositing Knight NFTs in those vaults, users must check their Knights on a regular basis through the Farming site, which is considered a polishing action. If users never check their Knights, the Glossiness of their Knights will deteriorate, and the Farming rewards will drop. So, to maintain the rewards from Knight NFTs, NFT owners must perform \""polishing\"" action, which means check their NFTs in the vaults regularly. ###\n**Formula to calculate Farming rewards**\n _**How to calculate the rewards for Copper, Silver and Gold Vaults?**_\nEach vault has a value called _emissionPerSecond_. This is a fixed amount that all depositors will be rewarded when they deposit NFT per second. Therefore, the fewer number of people staking NFT, the more rewards each staker will get.\n_**How to calculate the rewards for Diamond and Crystal Vaults?**_\nThe Glossiness of each NFT starts off at 100%, but it gradually decreases over time, affecting the incentives received when users deposit their NFTs in the vault. Users must complete \""Polishing\"" acts in order to receive 100% of the rewards.\nThe amount of reward from NFT polishing shall be calculated using 2 parameters: _decayRate_ and _decayInterval_. Concretely, after a _decayInterval_ (a certain amount of time), if the NFT is not polished, the rewards for the next _decayInterval_ will be reduced (_decayRate_ , calculated in % will decrease)\nFor example: _decayInterval_ = 2 days and _decayRate_ = 10% indicates that: every two days without polishing, the rewards of the next day will be reduced (due to the NFT glossiness). Hence, after 20 days, the amount of rewards for NFT will be 0.\nIf you stake NFT for a period _t_ = 9, the amount of incentives that you probably get is 450 Trava (On average per day you will get 450/9 = 50). However, you have forgotten to polish for 9 days. Then, the amount of rewards you receive is only 370 Trava. The amount of incentive you get is described as below:\n**Minus Rewards**\n10%\n10%\n20%\n20%\n30%\n30%\n40%\n**Remaining Rewards(TRAVA)**\nThe detailed calculation us as follows: (X is the rewards NFT depositor will receive after t days)\nThe average rewards each day NFT staker will receive:\nm=m = \\frac{X}{t}\nNumber of _decayInterval_ that depositor have to go through:\nn=tdecayIntervaln = \\frac{t}{decayInterval}decayInterval​\nThe result of this calculation will be rounded down.\n * If n < , the rewards depositor will receive is: m t = X\n * If n 1decayInterval\\frac{1}{decayInterval}decayInterval​\n\n\nThe percentage of minus rewards you get at the end of decayInterval period:\np=(n−1)∗decayRatep = ( n - 1) *decayRatedecayRate\nThe total amount of incentives you will receive:\nm∗[(2−p)∗n∗decayInterval2+(t−n∗dacayInterval)∗(1−p−decayRate)]m *[ (2 - p ) * n * \\frac{decayInterval}{2} + (t - n * dacayInterval) * (1 - p - decayRate) ]decayInterval​+dacayInterval)∗decayRate)]\n * If 1decayRate\\frac{1}{decayRate} decayRate​< n:\n\n\nThe total amount of rewards you get:\nm∗(1decayRate+1)∗decayInterval2m * (\\frac{1}{decayRate} + 1 )* \\frac{decayInterval} {2} (decayRate​+decayInterval​\nIn the above example, we have _X = 450, t = 9_\nWe can calculate: _m = 50, n = 4, p= 0.3_\nPut into the formula, we get:\n50∗[(2−0.3)∗4∗+(9−4∗2)∗(1−0.3−0.1)]=37050 * [(2 - 0.3) * 4 * \\frac{2}{2} + (9 - 4 * 2) * (1 -0.3 -0.1) ] = 3700.3)∗0.1)]= ##\n**Heuristic Farming (Farming based on EXP)**\nWhen the new Farming mechanism commences, _**our 5 current Farming vaults will stop distributing TRAVA as reward**_ , which means our 5 existing vaults will only give back EXP (one EXP for each second in 5 current farming vaults). This change supports NFT owners to gain EXP to enter Heuristic Farming with better rewards.\nIn the new Farming mechanism, we provide 5 more vaults for Heuristic Farming, and you can deposit as many knights as you want into each Vault, provided that those knights have the same rarity as that Vault. Rewards from Heuristic Farming are **rTRAVA tokens and EXP** (one EXP for every 3 seconds in the vault). The higher EXP, the higher the APR, the higher the rTRAVA reward.\n**Normal Farming**\n**Heuristic Farming**\nNumber of vaults\n5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities\n5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities\nNumber of Knights allowed in one vault\n1 Knight\n1 Knight\nReward in tokens\nNone\nrTRAVA\nEXP reward\nOne EXP is released for each second Knights in the vaults\nOne EXP is released for 3 second Knights in the vaults\nWith the new and improved mechanism, the EXP points are a crucial element in the development of the Trava Knight NFT journey. Like the current Farming mechanism, Heuristic Farming also has a Polishing mechanism. The polishing mechanism in Heuristic Farming helps NFT owners maintain 100% rewards and supports increasing EXP and APY.\nNote that, Knights with 0 EXP still gain rewards from Heuristic Farming. Moreover, with rTRAVA from Heuristic Farming, users can auto-stake in our rTRAVA with no locking period in our Staking Program. rTRAVA then can be locked in Trava Governance vault to gain locking power as veTRAVA and earn more rewards. ###\n**Calculation Formula of Emission Per Second**\nFrom now on, the eps will automatically change depending on the number of Knight NFTs and their EXP. For particular, the equation is demonstrated as below:\nWith the following parameters:\n_eps: Emission Per Second_\n _x: The number of Knights in the vault_\n _X: The starting eps_\n _Y: The maximum eps that can be reached_\n _Z: The eps will converge, when the number of Knight NFTs increases in the vault_\n _m: The number of Knight NFTs in the vault that own eps reaches the maximum rate (Y)_\n_u:__is calculated as_\n _a: is calculated as_\na=2∗∗(m−1)a = 2 * \\frac{Y - Z}{u + 1} * (m-1)​∗\n _b: is calculated as_\nb=u∗(m−1)b = \\frac{u}{u + 1} * (m-1)\n_c: is calculated as_\nc=(c = (\\frac{m-1}{u + 1})^{2} (​\nFor example, We have the following parameters:\nThe starting eps is 100 Trava/s\n _X_ = 100\nThe maximum eps is 400 Trava/s at the rate of 1000 NFTs\n _Y = 400_\n _m = 1000_\nThe eps will converge at 250 Trava/s when the number of NFTs passes\n _Z_ = 250\nThe chart is presented as below:\nFrom the chart, we can see that when there are little NFTs in the vault then the eps is low, and continuously increases when the number of NFTs in the vault reaches a certain rate. After that, the eps start to decrease and converge to a certain rate. ###\n**Calculation Value of NFT**\nThe value of NFT depends on its EXP:\nFor specific, the formula is calculated as below:\nvalue=86400+100value = \\frac{exp}{86400} + 100value=86400​+\n_Note_ :\n_exp:_ EXP of the NFT\n _value:_ The Value of the NFT\nFor example:\nWith NFT that has _**0 EXP**_ : Its Value will be _**100**_\nWith NFT has _**864000 EXP**_ : Its Value will be _**110**_\nWith NFT has _**8640000 EXP**_ : Its Value will be _**200**_\nBecause, in every 3 seconds, the NFT can earn 1 EXP, the NFT needs 259200 seconds or almost 3 days to increase 1 Value.\n**NOTE:** In order not to waste BNB, users should Polish the NFT in at least 3 days. ###\nAPR Calculation Formula for NFT\nAPR of a Knight NFT depends on 4 elements:\neps: Emission Per Second\nvalue: The EXP Value of Knight\ntotalValue: The Total Value of the total number of Knights in Vault\nprice: The price of Knight based on the weekly recalculation\n _**For specific, the formula is:**_\nAPR=eps∗valuetotalValue∗price∗24∗60∗60∗365∗100%APR = \\frac{eps * value}{totalValue*price} *24*60*60*365*100\\%totalValue∗priceeps∗value​∗100%\n_**For example,**_ there are 4 Knight NFTs with the similar rarity in 1 vault with the EXP in turn of 0, 86400, 864000, 8640000.\neps: 0.05 TRAVA per second\nThe rarity of the Knight is Diamond, which is priced at 150000 TRAVA\nTherefore, APR will be calculated as below:\n**Knight 1**\n**Knight 2**\n**Knight 3**\n**Knight 4**\n**totalValue**\nEXP\n86400\n864000\n8640000\nValue\n100\n101\n110\n200\n= 511\nAPR\n205.71%\n205.77%\n226.29%\n411.43%\nPreviousTrava NFT MarketplaceNextTrade-up Mechanism\nLast updated 2 years ago"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/nfts/trava-nft-farming"", ""rrf_score"": 0.11805555555555555 }, { ""content"": ""Following the Reward mechanism, 40% of users' rewards will be put in the vesting pool and be claimed gradually.\n * The winner can claim their reward every 24 hours.\n * The vesting percentage will be calculated:\n\n\nClaimablereward=RemainingReward∗%ClaimClaimable reward = Remaining Reward * \\% Claim Claimablereward=RemainingReward∗%Claim\n _The % claim depends on the number of referees that this winner invites to the game (referral mechanism)_\nRef\nClaim\n10%\n15%\n25%\n40%\n100%\nPreviousRewards MechanismNextLeaderboard mechanism\nLast updated 1 year ago"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/pottery-mechanism/rewards-mechanism/vesting-pool-mechanism"", ""rrf_score"": 0.1125 }, { ""content"": ""##\nChecking profile\nClick on your account number to access the profile page:\nOn the profile page, you will know the information about your level, the amount of rewards earned and claimed, the number of people referred, and your quiz packages organized by their status:\n * Pending (your finished quiz packages waiting to end)\n * Claimable (your quiz packages that ended but you have not received the reward)\n * Claimed (your quiz packages that you have received rewards)\n * Lost (quiz packages for which you do not receive a reward) ##\nRewards Mechanism\nYou can read more details about the rewards mechanism of the Pottery here. ###\nVesting Pool\nThis includes 40% of Pottery’s total reward, which you can claim daily (24 hours), with the amount depending on the number of friends you have successfully invited to join Pottery.

BRicher can automatically build up the most optimized strategies for users to maximize their profit._\n_For the continuous development of BRicher, we implement the new and innovative function —_** _Investment Portfolio_** _, which gathers and analyzes users’ investment data from various DApps. As a result, while similar apps show users’ balances only, BRicher helps users effectively manage their total assets (balance, loans, deposits) and shows comprehensive information about their investment on various DApps; all are displayed in a single place._\n \n**What problem does BRicher Investment Portfolio tend to solve, and what do users gain from it?**\nDApps and tokens come in a wide variety due to the size of the DeFi world. If investors put their money into different DApps, It would be challenging for them to:\n * Grasp the total value of tokens in their balance and the total amount of their deposits and borrows.\n * Keep track of the ecosystems/protocols they are borrowing/depositing and their financial performance.\n\n\nIn addition, unmanageable and complicated information storage also leads to difficulties in making the right and quick decision, which plays a significant role in the blockchain world.\n**_Investment Portfolio is therefore designed to address these issues and provide consumers with the following benefits:_**\n * Keep track of the fluctuation in their balance, loans, deposits, and total assets.\n * Monitor investment processes in different protocols and easily compare the investments’ capital, return, and ROI.\n * Get notifications and warnings when opening the portfolio pages. In the latter version, such warnings will be available via email and Telegram.\n\n\n \n**What differentiates BRicher’s investment portfolio from others?**\n_To solve the existing problems and give users the best user experience, we provide them with the following distinctive features:_\n \n**What differentiates BRicher’s investment portfolio from others?**\n_To solve the existing problems and give users the best user experience, we provide them with the following distinctive features:_\n\n**Calculation of Balance, loans, deposits, and total assets**\nIt is easy to check the balance, but almost all investors have problems managing their loans, deposits, and total assets. BRicher addresses these problems and calculates these parameters for them. Information is designed and presented in an elegant manner so that the investors can easily get insights.\n \n**What differentiates BRicher’s investment portfolio from others?**\n_To solve the existing problems and give users the best user experience, we provide them with the following distinctive features:_\n\n**Collects and displays key metrics related to users’ investing plans across different DApps.**\nAs usual, users have to go to each DApps and look up the needed information which is inconvenient and time-consuming. However, with BRicher, all these data are collected and displayed in the same place. As a result, users can easily compare the amount of money locked, the claimable bonuses, the current ROI, and the historical ROI of each investment strategy.\nBricher currently classifies two investment options related to lending pools and staking vaults. Depending on the option type, more detailed information will be presented when the user clicks on a specific option. For example, with a lending pool, they can see the total borrows, deposits, deposited and borrowed tokens, health factors, etc."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-brichers-investment-portfolio-5032d7598ff7?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----49-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.15476190476190477 }, { ""content"": ""_BRicher is a unique aggregator that composes multiple investment methods: providing liquidity, swapping, staking, depositing, and borrowing in the lending pools._\n_Based on the methods, BRicher automatically builds up_ _**composite strategies**_ _so that you can get the most optimized strategies to maximize your profit.

Strategies with a low number of steps are typically safer, but strategies with a high number of steps are usually more profitable.\n\n\n * By default, recommended strategies are automatically composed of all yield farming methods. If you do not like a specific method, please deselect it.\n\n\n * Some vaults/pools offer very high ROI, and they thus dominate the recommended strategies. To explore the other strategies that DO NOT include these vaults/pools, you can add the reward tokens of the vaults/pools to the control.\n\n\n**Step 4.** Click the “Make strategies” button\n * Our algorithm will automatically compute and return appropriate strategies to you.

Moreover, unlike other aggregators, BRicher lets investors own their tokens so that they can take complete control of capital and investment plans._\n \nThe first version of BRicher\nIn the first version, BRicher provided users with effective investment strategies with high returns and helped them keep track of their diaries (ROI and other critical parameters).\n_An investment strategy suggested by BRicher_\nHowever, the problem is that after discovering their best investment suggestion, users need to implement all the investing processes by themself, which is significantly time-consuming. Additionally, some “newbies” unfamiliar with various DApps may find it challenging to accomplish complicated operations independently.\nTo address these problems and provide users with more optimized options, we would like to offer new functions: Auto Investing and Semi-auto Investing.\nAs their name — “Auto”- these two new functions will automatically simplify the investment process and save investors much time.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n** _What is the Semi-auto Investing function?_**\n_Semi-auto Investing is a new feature that allows users to finish different stages of the investment strategies directly on the BRicher interface rather than on other DApps._\nIn more detail, recommended strategies usually consist of several steps, each with smaller operations. Performing all of these tasks in multiple DApps can be challenging and time-consuming.\nIn this case, the Semi-auto Investing function supports users effectively by allowing them to gradually execute the strategies on only one site — BRicher. That means even though users still need to invest step by step, there will be one button for each stage on BRicher’s interface for them to click on and complete the process easier.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n**_What benefit does it bring to users?_**\n * It is much more convenient than the Manual Investing feature, which requires users to access each DApps and execute the required steps.\n * Investors can control and keep track of each step of the investment implementation. That helps them to deeply understand the progress and, more importantly, make the modification in each step (cancel, for example) if necessary.\n\n\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What is the Auto Investing function?_**\nUpgraded from Semi-auto Investing, the Auto investing function requires users nothing but to click one only button. By doing that, the user authorizes BRicher to fully automate every phase of the investing strategy.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What benefits does it bring to users?_**\n * The implementation of investment plans is made simpler by condensing complicated multi-step procedures into a single button.\n * Compared to Manual investing and Semi-auto Investing, this function saves considerable time and effort for users.\n\n\n \nThe fundamental difference between these two functions\nFor a better understanding of the essential difference between Auto investing and Semi-auto Investing, let us take an example:\nAssuming that BRicher suggests users implement an investment plan that includes two main steps:\n * Swap their tokens to TRAVA on PancakeSwap\n * Stake TRAVA on the Trava governance vault to earn rewards and voting power.\n\n\nWith the Semi-auto Investing function, there will be two execute buttons corresponding two steps mentioned.

BRicher can automatically build up the most optimized strategies for users to maximize their profit._\n_For the continuous development of BRicher, we implement the new and innovative function —_** _Investment Portfolio_** _, which gathers and analyzes users’ investment data from various DApps. As a result, while similar apps show users’ balances only, BRicher helps users effectively manage their total assets (balance, loans, deposits) and shows comprehensive information about their investment on various DApps; all are displayed in a single place._\n \n**What problem does BRicher Investment Portfolio tend to solve, and what do users gain from it?**\nDApps and tokens come in a wide variety due to the size of the DeFi world. If investors put their money into different DApps, It would be challenging for them to:\n * Grasp the total value of tokens in their balance and the total amount of their deposits and borrows.\n * Keep track of the ecosystems/protocols they are borrowing/depositing and their financial performance.\n\n\nIn addition, unmanageable and complicated information storage also leads to difficulties in making the right and quick decision, which plays a significant role in the blockchain world.\n**_Investment Portfolio is therefore designed to address these issues and provide consumers with the following benefits:_**\n * Keep track of the fluctuation in their balance, loans, deposits, and total assets.\n * Monitor investment processes in different protocols and easily compare the investments’ capital, return, and ROI.\n * Get notifications and warnings when opening the portfolio pages. In the latter version, such warnings will be available via email and Telegram.\n\n\n \n**What differentiates BRicher’s investment portfolio from others?**\n_To solve the existing problems and give users the best user experience, we provide them with the following distinctive features:_\n \n**What differentiates BRicher’s investment portfolio from others?**\n_To solve the existing problems and give users the best user experience, we provide them with the following distinctive features:_\n\n**Calculation of Balance, loans, deposits, and total assets**\nIt is easy to check the balance, but almost all investors have problems managing their loans, deposits, and total assets. BRicher addresses these problems and calculates these parameters for them. Information is designed and presented in an elegant manner so that the investors can easily get insights.\n \n**What differentiates BRicher’s investment portfolio from others?**\n_To solve the existing problems and give users the best user experience, we provide them with the following distinctive features:_\n\n**Collects and displays key metrics related to users’ investing plans across different DApps.**\nAs usual, users have to go to each DApps and look up the needed information which is inconvenient and time-consuming. However, with BRicher, all these data are collected and displayed in the same place. As a result, users can easily compare the amount of money locked, the claimable bonuses, the current ROI, and the historical ROI of each investment strategy.\nBricher currently classifies two investment options related to lending pools and staking vaults.

""content"": ""In this section, you can search for high-return investment strategies based on your input tokens. Every time you access this page, BRicher automatically calculates and presents the best strategies to you.
Step 1. To use the Strategy Exploring page, you must connect and authenticate your wallet first:
- Click the “Connect wallet” button, choose a wallet, enter your password and confirm.
- Then click the “Authenticate” button.
Step 2. Select the token you prefer to invest in by clicking one option under the line “Select token to invest”.

Step 3. Select “More setting” to filter the recommended strategies

First, you can sort strategies by safety index, ROI, or the number of steps of the strategies.

You can also set the limit for the number of steps used in your strategies. Strategies with a low number of steps are typically safer, but strategies with a high number of steps are usually more profitable.

By default, recommended strategies are automatically composed of all yield farming methods. If you do not like a specific method, please deselect it.

Some vaults/pools offer very high ROI, and they thus dominate the recommended strategies. To explore the other strategies that DO NOT include these vaults/pools, you can add the reward tokens of the vaults/pools to the control.

Step 4. Click the “Make strategies” button

Our algorithm will automatically compute and return appropriate strategies to you. You should pay more attention to the strategy title (which includes names of used DApps), the safety index, the number of steps, and the Return On Investment rate.

As a result, it is challenging to crawl data from different projects, come up with the best investing strategy, and more importantly, implement it.\nIn this case, aggregators do exactly what their name suggested — aggregating information and combining all investing activities into one place. That allows users quickly make decisions and invest with simple steps, saving them considerable time and effort.\n> **_BRicher,_****_developed by_**** _Trava Finance_**** _is an aggregator._**\nHowever, differentiated from others, BRicher offers users multiple investing methods: providing liquidity, swapping, staking, depositing, and borrowing in the lending pools, etc. Moreover, it also supports investors well in exploring and monitoring their investment strategies. Details are in the following parts. # What differentiate BRicher from others?\n_In addition to the benefits that common aggregators bring to investors, BRicher offers them unique and one-of-a-kind utilities:_\n**Various types of investment strategies**\nBRicher considers all types of yield farmings: Data on many liquidity providers, lending, borrowing, and staking protocols are all collected and evaluated so that the aggregator can build up high-return investment strategies and share the best ones with investors.\nDifferent investing strategies recommended to users\n**Detailed and transparent information**\nWhile other aggregators don’t usually publicize their investment plans, BRicher assures all information on the recommended investment strategy is visible to users. All relevant information is collected and put in a single place, called BRicher’s Investment Portfolio, for investors in the most intuitive manner. Thus, they can easily verify the recommended plan by themselves.\nMoreover, instead of sharing the real-time ROI only, BRicher reveals the historical ROI of every investment plan. The ROI history and the AI-based safety index provide investors with valuable information before deciding whether to stick to the plan or not.\n**Composite strategies: an automatic combination of multiple types of investment strategies**\nMost current aggregators focus on providing simple-choice investment strategies with a single action (e.g., staking, depositing, or providing liquidity pairs). Although some of them are able to suggest composite strategies composed of multiple investing activities, these plans are typically built in a manual manner. That leads to some limitations as follows:\n * **Limited options:** recommended strategies might not be applicable to the investors’ tokens.\n * **Outdate investing strategies** : As it takes time to manually create new high-return investment strategies, they are not updated with the better ones.\n * **Unpublished information:** the manual-created strategy operates as a black box to users and thus it is challenging for them to evaluate such a strategy and put their trust in it.\n\n\nAddressing these problems, BRicher has developed innovative algorithms that build up the best strategies based on the custom inputs of investors. They can be either single-action strategies or **composite strategies (** consisting of a series of actions). Furthermore, BRicher provides thorough information on each action so that users can easily check, estimate, and make their own choices.\n**Allowing users to keep track of their own investment process**\nLastly, BRicher allows investors to add an investment plan to their investing diaries. They hence can keep track of all of their plans: monitoring how their ROI goes up and down and checking how much they have earned. In addition, they will also receive notifications as soon as their strategies are going to expire or there have been other strategies with higher ROI than the current one. # **BRicher and our long-term vision**\nBRicher is developed in two phases. In the first phase, it supports investors collect relevant and detailed information and come up with the best investment plans.\nIn the second one, it will help users to cut off their “money-making process” even more, by allowing them to implement various tradings and transactions “all-in-one-click” with Auto investing and Semi-auto investing functions.\nAs our long-term vision is to implement a fully decentralized lending marketplace where users can own their lending pools, BRicher plays a significant role in supporting both pool owners and those who invest in these pools.\nBRicher also supports in managing their treasury investment portfolios which maintain the sustainable development of the protocol and thus benefit TOD holders in the long-term.\nFurthermore, as it is capable of combining multiple yield farming methods to offer the best investment strategies to investors, we expect BRicher to go further beyond the Trava ecosystem to foster the development of the DeFi world."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-bricher-light-up-your-path-to-be-richer-2e1b42a111e7?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----58-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""##\nI \n**Input token** The type of token investors spend as initial capital.\n**Investment Diaries** A Function that allows users to save and track their investment plans. ##\nM \n**Manually invest** Manually investing means you follow our instructions step by step to implement the strategy. ##\nN \n**Number of steps** The number of investment steps included in a suggested strategy. ##\nO \n**Output token** The type of token investors receive as benefits from the investment strategy. \n**One-step strategy** An investment plan that usually consists of only one investment action (with a particular method)."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/glossary/bricher-glossary"", ""rrf_score"": 0.06315789473684211 }, { ""content"": ""###\n**“BRicher diaries” section**\nBRicher lists all of your investment strategies on this page.\nYou can change the name of a strategy to recognize it easily by clicking the “Pen” icon and also delete a strategy with the “Trash bin” icon.\nTo get detailed information on a strategy, please click the “Detail” button.\nIn addition to the basic information, BRicher helps you to estimate your interest in this strategy based on your original capital and the ROI history.\nThe ROI History is illustrated in a chart.

Users can only execute one investment strategy at one time. That means they must finish or cancel the previous investing progress if they want to implement the other plans. Users can implement their strategies and quit the page in the middle. We support them in resuming the implementation process. However, there might be changes in prices and other parameters that affect the strategy.

Moreover, unlike other aggregators, BRicher lets investors own their tokens so that they can take complete control of capital and investment plans._\n \nThe first version of BRicher\nIn the first version, BRicher provided users with effective investment strategies with high returns and helped them keep track of their diaries (ROI and other critical parameters).\n_An investment strategy suggested by BRicher_\nHowever, the problem is that after discovering their best investment suggestion, users need to implement all the investing processes by themself, which is significantly time-consuming. Additionally, some “newbies” unfamiliar with various DApps may find it challenging to accomplish complicated operations independently.\nTo address these problems and provide users with more optimized options, we would like to offer new functions: Auto Investing and Semi-auto Investing.\nAs their name — “Auto”- these two new functions will automatically simplify the investment process and save investors much time.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n** _What is the Semi-auto Investing function?_**\n_Semi-auto Investing is a new feature that allows users to finish different stages of the investment strategies directly on the BRicher interface rather than on other DApps._\nIn more detail, recommended strategies usually consist of several steps, each with smaller operations. Performing all of these tasks in multiple DApps can be challenging and time-consuming.\nIn this case, the Semi-auto Investing function supports users effectively by allowing them to gradually execute the strategies on only one site — BRicher. That means even though users still need to invest step by step, there will be one button for each stage on BRicher’s interface for them to click on and complete the process easier.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n**_What benefit does it bring to users?_**\n * It is much more convenient than the Manual Investing feature, which requires users to access each DApps and execute the required steps.\n * Investors can control and keep track of each step of the investment implementation. That helps them to deeply understand the progress and, more importantly, make the modification in each step (cancel, for example) if necessary.\n\n\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What is the Auto Investing function?_**\nUpgraded from Semi-auto Investing, the Auto investing function requires users nothing but to click one only button. By doing that, the user authorizes BRicher to fully automate every phase of the investing strategy.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What benefits does it bring to users?_**\n * The implementation of investment plans is made simpler by condensing complicated multi-step procedures into a single button.\n * Compared to Manual investing and Semi-auto Investing, this function saves considerable time and effort for users.\n\n\n \nThe fundamental difference between these two functions\nFor a better understanding of the essential difference between Auto investing and Semi-auto Investing, let us take an example:\nAssuming that BRicher suggests users implement an investment plan that includes two main steps:\n * Swap their tokens to TRAVA on PancakeSwap\n * Stake TRAVA on the Trava governance vault to earn rewards and voting power.\n\n\nWith the Semi-auto Investing function, there will be two execute buttons corresponding two steps mentioned. In this case, investors can finish the investment process simply by clicking on these two buttons.\nWith the Auto investing function, the progress is even more optimized when they only need to click on one button.\n_Notes that: Unlike other Aggregators, Bricher does not hold investors’ tokens. In fact, they only authorize (approve) tokens, not transfer tokens to Bricher.

We provide all relevant information related to every single step of a_** _composite strategy,_**_and you can easily verify it by yourselves._\n_This article provides readers with a thorough guideline to use this feature effectively._\nUser Guide for BRicher\nBRicher includes three pages: _Home_ , _Strategy Exploring,_ and _Investment diaries_.\nThe Home page lists the best one-step investment strategies.\nThe Strategy Exploring page lets you discover high-return investment strategies according to your tokens and personal settings.\nFinally, on the Investment diaries page, you can monitor your selected strategies with information on their capital, ROIs, interest, start date, expiration date, and so on.\n \n**Home page**\nThe _Home_ page lists the best one-step investment strategies for all tokens supported by BRicher. Exciting information on each strategy, such as its current ROI, ROI history, transaction fee, and reward tokens, are shown on the table. In addition, you can select a row to get detailed information on the respective strategy.\nAt the right upper corner of the page, you can enter your favorite token to filter strategies.\nTo sort the strategies, you can press on the table headers.\n \n**Strategy Exploring**\nTo use the _Strategy Exploring_ page, you must connect your wallet first.\nChoose wallet\nAfter authenticating your wallet, you will see a screen like this:\nYou can search for high-return investment strategies based on your input tokens on the Strategy Exploring page. Please follow the following steps:\n**Step 1**. Select the token you want to invest\n**Step 2**. Select “**More setting** ” to filter the recommended strategies\nFirst, you can sort strategies by safety index, ROI, or a number of steps.\nYou can set the limit for the number of steps used in your strategies. Strategies with a low number of steps are typically safer, but strategies with a high number of steps are usually more profitable.\nBy default, recommended strategies use all yield farming methods. If you do not like a specific method, please deselect it.\nSome vaults/pools offer very high ROI, thus dominating the recommended strategies. To explore the other strategies that do not include these vaults/pools, you can add the reward tokens of the vaults/pools to the control.\n**Step 3**. Click the “ _Make strategies_ ” button\nOur **algorithm** will automatically compute and return appropriate strategies for you. You should pay more attention to the strategy title (which includes names of used DApps), the safety index, the number of steps, and the Return On Investment rate.\n**Step 4** : If you are interested in a strategy, please click its _“Check detail and Invest”_ button\nBRicher will show general information on the strategy, such as its start and expiration date, reward tokens, estimated gas, ROI history, etc.\nBRicher also displays all helpful information on each step. The relevant information is shown depending on the type of method used in the step (staking, depositing, borrowing, providing liquidity pair, swapping). All of them are real-time data collected by BRicher that can save your time in making decisions.\nAt this version of BRicher, please follow the instruction to invest manually by yourselves. Then you click on the “manual invest” button, enter the amount of token you have invested, and press the confirm button. BRicher will save your strategies so that you can monitor the strategy’s effectiveness (the capital, the interest, the reward token, the ROIs, etc.)\nIn the next version of BRicher, we will automatically implement the strategy for you, but you still own your tokens.

Moreover, unlike other aggregators, BRicher lets investors own their tokens so that they can take complete control of capital and investment plans._\n \nThe first version of BRicher\nIn the first version, BRicher provided users with effective investment strategies with high returns and helped them keep track of their diaries (ROI and other critical parameters).\n_An investment strategy suggested by BRicher_\nHowever, the problem is that after discovering their best investment suggestion, users need to implement all the investing processes by themself, which is significantly time-consuming. Additionally, some “newbies” unfamiliar with various DApps may find it challenging to accomplish complicated operations independently.\nTo address these problems and provide users with more optimized options, we would like to offer new functions: Auto Investing and Semi-auto Investing.\nAs their name — “Auto”- these two new functions will automatically simplify the investment process and save investors much time.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n** _What is the Semi-auto Investing function?_**\n_Semi-auto Investing is a new feature that allows users to finish different stages of the investment strategies directly on the BRicher interface rather than on other DApps._\nIn more detail, recommended strategies usually consist of several steps, each with smaller operations. Performing all of these tasks in multiple DApps can be challenging and time-consuming.\nIn this case, the Semi-auto Investing function supports users effectively by allowing them to gradually execute the strategies on only one site — BRicher. That means even though users still need to invest step by step, there will be one button for each stage on BRicher’s interface for them to click on and complete the process easier.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n**_What benefit does it bring to users?_**\n * It is much more convenient than the Manual Investing feature, which requires users to access each DApps and execute the required steps.\n * Investors can control and keep track of each step of the investment implementation. That helps them to deeply understand the progress and, more importantly, make the modification in each step (cancel, for example) if necessary.\n\n\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What is the Auto Investing function?_**\nUpgraded from Semi-auto Investing, the Auto investing function requires users nothing but to click one only button. By doing that, the user authorizes BRicher to fully automate every phase of the investing strategy.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What benefits does it bring to users?_**\n * The implementation of investment plans is made simpler by condensing complicated multi-step procedures into a single button.\n * Compared to Manual investing and Semi-auto Investing, this function saves considerable time and effort for users.\n\n\n \nThe fundamental difference between these two functions\nFor a better understanding of the essential difference between Auto investing and Semi-auto Investing, let us take an example:\nAssuming that BRicher suggests users implement an investment plan that includes two main steps:\n * Swap their tokens to TRAVA on PancakeSwap\n * Stake TRAVA on the Trava governance vault to earn rewards and voting power.\n\n\nWith the Semi-auto Investing function, there will be two execute buttons corresponding two steps mentioned. In this case, investors can finish the investment process simply by clicking on these two buttons.\nWith the Auto investing function, the progress is even more optimized when they only need to click on one button.\n_Notes that: Unlike other Aggregators, Bricher does not hold investors’ tokens. In fact, they only authorize (approve) tokens, not transfer tokens to Bricher. Thus your tokens will always be yours._"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-bricher-auto-investing-and-semi-auto-investing-82037b50eb6b?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----46-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.10416666666666666 }, { ""content"": ""M \n**Manually invest** Manually investing means you follow our instructions step by step to implement the strategy."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/glossary/bricher-glossary"", ""rrf_score"": 0.09316770186335403 } ] }",True,True,True,True,FALSE,False,,,,['https://docs.trava.finance/user-guide/bricher-user-guide'],"['Step 1.

Once that happens, there will be an instruction pop-up window.

That means they must finish or cancel the previous investing progress if they want to implement the other plans. Users can implement their strategies and quit the page in the middle.

In this case, veTRAVA, in the form of NFT, represents this power and is determined by the time and amount of locked tokens (as they show your commitment toward the future of Trava Finance).\nWith the implementation of the Trava Governance Vault, users can lock their TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB into this vault to receive a certain amount of veTRAVA representing their powers: the more veTRAVA you own, the higher your voting power in the Trava ecosystem. ## The Benefits Of Owning veTRAVA\nThe key value of veTRAVA is its representative of users’ power and their commitment to the project. As a result, in the long term, users who own veTRAVA can receive significant benefits:\n * Deciding on crucial parameters such as LTV, risk parameters, etc., in the lending pools (Trava Lending Pool and Users-owned Pools).\n * Receiving share profit coming from the fee charged by borrowers\n * Receiving boosting rewards **in rTRAVA** by providing liquidity and holding veTRAVA at the same time.\n * Earning TRAVA reward: the APR will be revealed soon.\n\n\nAs mentioned, veTRAVA is utilized as a form of NFT. For now, it can only be available for those who lock their token into the Governance Vault. However, it will be exchanged peer-to-peer with the launch of veTRAVA Marketplace. # veTRAVA Marketplace: Overview\nAs its name suggests, the veTRAVA marketplace is for users to buy and sell their veTRAVA. It means they can freely exchange their voting power. The main reason we came up with this idea is to optimize users’ experience, bringing them as much freedom as possible. It’s the “Decentralization” we are heading for.\nBesides bringing more freedom to users, veTRAVA Marketplace increases liquidity for veTRAVA and thus benefits both sellers and buyers. In more detail, buyers can buy veTRAVA (voting power) easily on Marketplace and then earn voting power immediately. In this case, the remaining locking time will be more flexible, no longer limited to a particular period set in the Governance Vault. When it comes to sellers, they can easily utilize crypto assets in a more liberal way and get benefits from it. ## The Influences of veTRAVA Marketplace\nveTRAVA Marketplace is an important feature that contributes to the development of Trava Governance.

Moreover, now with the new mechanism of Liquidity Pool for TRAVA/Ticket, the Marketplace is becoming more and more attractive than ever! Let’s have a better understanding of The Ticket Marketplace before it launches._ # What is Ticket Marketplace?\nTicket Marketplace is where users can come to buy or sell Tickets. Just like other NFT Marketplaces, this platform supports peer-to-peer transactions, in which sellers can determine the Ticket prices and buyers can freely choose the suitable prices to buy.\nMoreover, in order to celebrate the events of Presale and Public Offering, Ticket Marketplace applies the Liquidity Pool mechanism, including swapping and providing liquidity, so that users can gain additional profits. # Ticket Marketplace Sell and Buy Mechanisms\nSimilar to other NFT Marketplaces, the Trava Ticket Marketplace basis mechanism supports peer-to-peer transactions. Sellers can set their own preferred prices for Tickets and sell them. Moreover, sellers can pay an extra fee in TRAVA to pin their Tickets on the top page and attract more buyers. Sellers can set the Ticket prices and gain more profit depending on the gap between the selling price and purchasing cost.\nIn terms of buyers, they can find good Ticket prices on the Marketplace to purchase. Instead of buying from the Counter, buyers can freely choose the Ticket on the Marketplace at a much more affordable price.\nThis Sell and Buy Mechanism of Ticket Marketplace can be applied for all three types of Tickets, including Counter Ticket, Presale Ticket, and Incentive Ticket. # Presale Ticket/TRAVA Pool\nAfter the Presale and the ongoing Public Offering, Trava Team has decided to implement a Liquidity Pool in the Ticket Marketplace. This mechanism consists of 2 main actions, swapping and providing liquidity.\n**‼️ Note:** **This pool is FIRST APPLIED FOR PRESALE TICKETS.** ## Swap Ticket or Trava\nUsers can swap Presale Ticket to Trava or Trava to Presale Ticket with the listing price of $1.2. The price will be converted to TRAVA price at the listing time.\nFor example, Alice wants to swap 1 Presale Ticket to TRAVA with the price of TRAVA at that time was $0,000415, and the listing price is fixed at $1.2\n=> Alice will receive ~2.891 TRAVA.\nWith the swapping Ticket or Trava mechanism, users can gain benefits by receiving larger profits than buying Ticket from Presale or Public Offering. Instead of owning a Ticket that has the price of $0.6 from Presale, the Ticket from swapping has a higher value and can be swapped with a larger amount of TRAVA. ## Provide Liquidity\nBesides swapping, there will also be a pool for TRAVA/Ticket. Users will have to provide Presale Tickets and TRAVA to receive TRAVA/Presale Ticket pair.\nWith this mechanism, liquidity providers can receive trading fees as rewards when the pool starts to facilitate trades.\n**‼️ NOTE:_THE LIQUIDITY POOL WILL BE LAUNCHED ON NOVEMBER 21, 2022!_**"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-of-trava-ticket-marketplace-5a04826eebf5?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----37-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.08391608391608392 }, { ""content"": ""##\n**Does Trava apply NFTs in the ecosystem?**\nYes, TRAVA allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract. ##\n**How does Trava price NFTs?**\nTrava will provide the auction function for NFT assets. Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way. We also avoid the price fluctuation of NFT because the NFTs have been priced in the auction contract before. ##\n**What can I do with NFTs after the auction?**\nTRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT.\nMeanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.\nPreviousTrava Credit ScoreNextListing\nLast updated 2 years ago\nWas this helpful?"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/faq/nfts"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""# Introduction To veTRAVA Marketplace\nPublished in\n3 min readFeb 9, 2023\nShare\nIntroduction to veTRAVA Marketplace\n _Along with the launch of Trava Governance, veTRAVA Marketplace brings Trava Finance to the next level of “Decentralized” by enabling peer-to-peer exchanging voting power, fostering the decision-making power of the whole ecosystem._ # What Is veTRAVA And Its Benefits?\n ## What is veTRAVA?\nTo fulfill the “decentralized” part of the Trava Decentralized Marketplace, we launched Trava Governance, based on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model, to give users decision-making power. In this case, veTRAVA, in the form of NFT, represents this power and is determined by the time and amount of locked tokens (as they show your commitment toward the future of Trava Finance).\nWith the implementation of the Trava Governance Vault, users can lock their TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB into this vault to receive a certain amount of veTRAVA representing their powers: the more veTRAVA you own, the higher your voting power in the Trava ecosystem. ## The Benefits Of Owning veTRAVA\nThe key value of veTRAVA is its representative of users’ power and their commitment to the project. As a result, in the long term, users who own veTRAVA can receive significant benefits:\n * Deciding on crucial parameters such as LTV, risk parameters, etc., in the lending pools (Trava Lending Pool and Users-owned Pools).\n * Receiving share profit coming from the fee charged by borrowers\n * Receiving boosting rewards **in rTRAVA** by providing liquidity and holding veTRAVA at the same time.\n * Earning TRAVA reward: the APR will be revealed soon.\n\n\nAs mentioned, veTRAVA is utilized as a form of NFT. For now, it can only be available for those who lock their token into the Governance Vault. However, it will be exchanged peer-to-peer with the launch of veTRAVA Marketplace. # veTRAVA Marketplace: Overview\nAs its name suggests, the veTRAVA marketplace is for users to buy and sell their veTRAVA. It means they can freely exchange their voting power. The main reason we came up with this idea is to optimize users’ experience, bringing them as much freedom as possible. It’s the “Decentralization” we are heading for.\nBesides bringing more freedom to users, veTRAVA Marketplace increases liquidity for veTRAVA and thus benefits both sellers and buyers. In more detail, buyers can buy veTRAVA (voting power) easily on Marketplace and then earn voting power immediately. In this case, the remaining locking time will be more flexible, no longer limited to a particular period set in the Governance Vault. When it comes to sellers, they can easily utilize crypto assets in a more liberal way and get benefits from it. ## The Influences of veTRAVA Marketplace\nveTRAVA Marketplace is an important feature that contributes to the development of Trava Governance. As mentioned above, users who hold many veTRAVA will have a crucial role in the decision-making process of the Trava Finance ecosystem. The veTRAVA holders can alternate the voting results, and through the Marketplace, users can buy or sell the voting power with others.\nWith the fact that users can trade their voting power to each other, anyone in the ecosystem will have a chance to vote for the changes they want to make in Trava Finance.

Every time you access this page, BRicher automatically calculates and presents the best strategies to you.\n**Step 1.** To use the Strategy Exploring page, you must connect and authenticate your wallet first:**-** Click the “Connect wallet” button, choose a wallet, enter your password and confirm. - Then click the “Authenticate” button.\n**Step 2.** Select the token you prefer to invest in by clicking one option under the line “Select token to invest”.\n**Step 3.** Select “More setting” to filter the recommended strategies\n * First, you can sort strategies by safety index, ROI, or the number of steps of the strategies.\n\n\n * You can also set the limit for the number of steps used in your strategies. Strategies with a low number of steps are typically safer, but strategies with a high number of steps are usually more profitable.\n\n\n * By default, recommended strategies are automatically composed of all yield farming methods. If you do not like a specific method, please deselect it.\n\n\n * Some vaults/pools offer very high ROI, and they thus dominate the recommended strategies. To explore the other strategies that DO NOT include these vaults/pools, you can add the reward tokens of the vaults/pools to the control.\n\n\n**Step 4.** Click the “Make strategies” button\n * Our algorithm will automatically compute and return appropriate strategies to you. You should pay more attention to the strategy title (which includes names of used DApps), the safety index, the number of steps, and the Return On Investment rate.\n\n\n _BRicher is a unique aggregator that composes multiple investment methods: providing liquidity, swapping, staking, depositing, and borrowing in the lending pools._\n_Based on the methods, BRicher automatically builds up_ _**composite strategies**_ _so that you can get the most optimized strategies to maximize your profit.

At this transit point, you can combine all DeFi actions in just one transaction, reducing time and fees compared to making multiple transactions on different platforms.\nThe ultimate goal of Trava Station is to enhance user performance. I think this is a very good feature for our users. You can experience it here 👉 https://app.trava.finance/station\nFor new users, Trava Station has a total of 4 main functions, including Freight, Portfolio, Tramlines and Junction, with the first three already launched as of now. The users can use Portfolio to track information, positions, and assets of their Smart Wallet in Trava Station.\nMeanwhile, Freight is where you can click, drag, and drop multiple actions in the Trava ecosystem to make a single transaction.

There were also a lot of new products being released, and will be released soon. That’s why we decided to launch the AMA “Arrive at Trava Station” on November 9 (2023), with the attendance of Ms. Tilly — Community Mod, Mr. Minh Nguyen — CEO & Co-founder of Trava Finance and Mr. Dat Trinh — Head of Data Analysis & Co-founder of Trava Finance.

Can you tell us what it is and the features this new product currently has, Mr. Minh?\n> _Mr. Minh Nguyen:_\nLaunched on Mainnet on September 21, Trava Station is a product we created with the goal of giving users the most convenient experience in the Trava ecosystem. At this transit point, you can combine all DeFi actions in just one transaction, reducing time and fees compared to making multiple transactions on different platforms.\nThe ultimate goal of Trava Station is to enhance user performance. I think this is a very good feature for our users. You can experience it here 👉 https://app.trava.finance/station\nFor new users, Trava Station has a total of 4 main functions, including Freight, Portfolio, Tramlines and Junction, with the first three already launched as of now. The users can use Portfolio to track information, positions, and assets of their Smart Wallet in Trava Station.\nMeanwhile, Freight is where you can click, drag, and drop multiple actions in the Trava ecosystem to make a single transaction. The latest feature released — Tramlines — include a set of pre-created Routes of common actions that you can import for personal uses in Trava Station 👉 https://app.trava.finance/station/tramlines\n \nDiscuss about the present product, especially Trava Station\n\nThe product is really easy to use and convenient, right everyone? It can be seen that Trava Station has been developed to a certain level, so is there anything else the team is preparing to make it even better, Mr. Dat?\n> _Mr. Dat Trinh:_\nOf course there is! If you have been following our newly released Roadmap, you can see that we have planned many stages for this product. First of all, we have been updating existing features in Trava Station, adding actions to Freight and routes to Tramlines. If you have any suggestions, please voice it in the community or go to the Forum topic.\nWe will also release the last feature in the group, which is Junction. It can essentially allow users to create Routes that only execute when a certain index or criteria that you have preset appears.

      ""content"": ""Introduction To BRicher Auto Investing And Semi-auto Investing\nPublished in\n4 min readSep 16, 2022\nShare\nIntroduction to BRicher’s new functions\n _BRicher is a unique aggregator that composes multiple investment methods: providing liquidity, swapping, staking, depositing, and borrowing in the lending pools._\n_In summary, these composite strategies are automatically built so that users can get the most optimized one to maximize their profit. Moreover, unlike other aggregators, BRicher lets investors own their tokens so that they can take complete control of capital and investment plans._\n \nThe first version of BRicher\nIn the first version, BRicher provided users with effective investment strategies with high returns and helped them keep track of their diaries (ROI and other critical parameters).\n_An investment strategy suggested by BRicher_\nHowever, the problem is that after discovering their best investment suggestion, users need to implement all the investing processes by themself, which is significantly time-consuming. Additionally, some “newbies” unfamiliar with various DApps may find it challenging to accomplish complicated operations independently.\nTo address these problems and provide users with more optimized options, we would like to offer new functions: Auto Investing and Semi-auto Investing.\nAs their name — “Auto”- these two new functions will automatically simplify the investment process and save investors much time.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n** _What is the Semi-auto Investing function?_**\n_Semi-auto Investing is a new feature that allows users to finish different stages of the investment strategies directly on the BRicher interface rather than on other DApps._\nIn more detail, recommended strategies usually consist of several steps, each with smaller operations. Performing all of these tasks in multiple DApps can be challenging and time-consuming.\nIn this case, the Semi-auto Investing function supports users effectively by allowing them to gradually execute the strategies on only one site — BRicher. That means even though users still need to invest step by step, there will be one button for each stage on BRicher’s interface for them to click on and complete the process easier.\n \nIntroduction to Semi-auto Investing function\n\n**_What benefit does it bring to users?_**\n  * It is much more convenient than the Manual Investing feature, which requires users to access each DApps and execute the required steps.\n  * Investors can control and keep track of each step of the investment implementation. That helps them to deeply understand the progress and, more importantly, make the modification in each step (cancel, for example) if necessary.\n\n\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What is the Auto Investing function?_**\nUpgraded from Semi-auto Investing, the Auto investing function requires users nothing but to click one only button. By doing that, the user authorizes BRicher to fully automate every phase of the investing strategy.\n \nIntroduction to Auto Investing function.\n\n**_What benefits does it bring to users?_**\n  * The implementation of investment plans is made simpler by condensing complicated multi-step procedures into a single button.\n  * Compared to Manual investing and Semi-auto Investing, this function saves considerable time and effort for users.\n\n\n \nThe fundamental difference between these two functions\nFor a better understanding of the essential difference between Auto investing and Semi-auto Investing, let us take an example:\nAssuming that BRicher suggests users implement an investment plan that includes two main steps:\n  * Swap their tokens to TRAVA on PancakeSwap\n  * Stake TRAVA on the Trava governance vault to earn rewards and voting power.\n\n\nWith the Semi-auto Investing function, there will be two execute buttons corresponding two steps mentioned. In this case, investors can finish the investment process simply by clicking on these two buttons.\nWith the Auto investing function, the progress is even more optimized when they only need to click on one button.\n_Notes that: Unlike other Aggregators, Bricher does not hold investors’ tokens. In fact, they only authorize (approve) tokens, not transfer tokens to Bricher. Thus your tokens will always be yours._"",

What is Smart Wallet and its purpose?,docs,"[{""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/trava-station/smart-wallet"",
""content"": ""To support the main features of Trava Station, we utilize Smart Wallet, which is a contract that represents the user (their proxy) and lets actions go through. Conditions and access permissions are encoded into these self-executing code, rendering it both secure and adaptable for managing financial resources. When you first join Trava Station, you will be asked to create a Smart Wallet, which will hold your assets during the operations.
With Trava Station, it now acts as an intermediary so that the requests of the users can be calculated and fulfilled in one go, making the experience much smoother. In addition, our Smart Wallet can serve as a stay point of your assets when you perform some special actions in the Trava ecosystem. For example, when you create an action with Freight in Trava Station to sell Armoury items, the money won’t immediately go into your Smart Wallet. The NFT will stay there until someone buys it on the Marketplace, at which point the process ends and now your Smart Wallet will hold the money from that sale.
Smart Wallet marks a pivotal juncture in our journey, offering heightened security and streamlined accessibility for Trava Station. For more information, you can check out our previous article on this Topic.

They are non-fungible, which naturally means that they are illiquid. Bringing liquidity to the NFT space would unlock a myriad of possibilities. As of May 2021, there have been no lending projects that make use of NFT as collaterals, because unlike a fungible currency or common stock, NFT value is difficult to determine. TRAVA.FINANCE adds more flexibility to the illiquid world of NFT and allows NFT owners to earn an ROI without selling it.\nTRAVA.FINANCE offers an innovative feature that prices NFTs based on auctions. After the auction, borrowers can use their NFTs as collateral. TRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT. Meanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.\nThe auction process is as follows:\n 1. The NFT owner opens an auction session; she sets (i) the legal crypto used in the auction, (ii) the initial price for her NFT, (iii) the countdown time for the auction session, (iv) the mode for her auction (i.e., _auction-to-sell or auction-for-buy-right_), and other auction terms.\n 2. TRAVA.FINANCE users, who are interested in the NFT, can join in the auction session. To encourage users to participate in auctions, at the end of the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE randomly selects several bidders and rewards them with TRAVA tokens extracted from the auction fees. To guarantee that the bidders make their payment when they win the auction, TRAVA.FINANCE locks a number of their TRAVA tokens as soon as they join in the auction session and make a bid. When the auction finishes, they will immediately get their tokens back if they are not the winner. In case they are the winners, they can get their tokens back only if they pay for the auctioning NFT before the deadline.\n 3. In the _auction-to-sell_ mode, the auction winner will pay the owner the whole auction price to get the NFT.\n 4. In the _auction-for-buy-right_ mode, the auction winners have to pay a part of the auction price. We name the quotient of the amount the winners have to pay over the auction price \""_auction-paid ratio_ ”. The auction-paid ratio is calculated from the creditworthiness of the lender, borrower, NFT, and the auction terms. The NFT owners can use the cryptos paid by the auction winner as collateral for their loans. Once they repay their loan including the interest to the auction winners, they can get the NFT back. Otherwise, they will lose their NFT to the auction winners. These rules are all defined in the auction smart contract.\n\n\nTRAVA.FINANCE provides benefits for all participants as described below.\n * **NFT owners** can determine their NFT value based on the bid prices given by the auction participants. The value can be much greater than their initial expectation. They can either directly sell their NFT or use their NFT as collateral and earn profit without losing it. TRAVA.FINANCE thus increases the liquidity of NFTs and opens up a unique and exciting NFTFi marketplace.\n * Based on the given number of auction bids, **bidders** have a corresponding chance to win the reward at the end of the auction session. This rewarding mechanism provides incentives for users to actively make a bid in the auction.\n * **Auction winners** can get their desired NFT at a price lower than their bidding price (once NFT owners cannot repay the loan) or they can receive considerable interest from their loan to NFT owners (once NFT owners repay the loans and get their NFT back).\n * The credit scores of **NFT owners, auction winners, bidders,** and **NFTs** can be improved after auctions.\n\n\nThe auction mechanism for NFT can also be applied to any type of digital asset. In our road map, TRAVA.FINANCE will implement this auction feature for various types of digital assets (e.g., stock token, smart contract).\nPreviousCredit Score EvaluationNextTokenomics\nLast updated 3 years ago\nWas this helpful?\n"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/collateralized-nfts"", ""rrf_score"": 0.08333333333333334 }, { ""content"": ""In the financial sector, a credit score is a value that represents the creditworthiness of an individual; the higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. Credit score evaluation is a distinctive technique that differentiates TRAVA.FINANCE and other decentralized lending approaches. TRAVA.FINANCE aggregates and analyzes all transactions of blockchain objects (e.g., user, wallet address, digital asset) on multiple networks. TRAVA.FINANCE then establishes links among them and evaluates their credit score in the most objective and transparent manner.\nTRAVA.FINANCE uses credit scores to ensure the safety of the lending process. Pool owners and lenders can rate borrowers’ credit and eliminate fraudulent accounts to increase capital efficiency and reduce the risk of bad debt. Based on the credit scores, they can determine the maximum Loan-To-Value ratio for borrowers. Borrowers with high credit scores get preferential treatment; they can borrow cryptos with more favorable interest rates and Loan-To-Value ratios. Credit scores provide an incentive for users to (i) hold their wallet addresses as long as possible and keep them clean, (ii) perform the cross-chain identification protocol to interlink their addresses, (iii) perform more transactions inside and outside TRAVA.FINANCE, and so on. This increases crypto liquidity and fosters the growth of the DeFi system.\nThe credit score evaluation in TRAVA.FINANCE is primarily based on on-chain data. At present, we collect, enrich, and analyze Binance Smart Chain transactions, including the native transferring transactions and the transactions to deposit, withdraw, repay, and borrow tokens generated from Binance Smart Chain lending DApps.\nTRAVA.FINANCE evaluates credit scores for both wallet addresses and other digital assets. Wallet addresses operated for a long time with good transaction history (e.g., an address that has transactions with many other addresses, always pays debts on time, and performs transactions frequently) will have a high credit score. Pool owners can use credit scores as a criterion to select competent wallet addresses for their pool’s liquidity providers.\nThe credit rating of digital assets helps pool owners and liquid providers to minimize liquidity risk. TRAVA.FINANCE divides digital assets into two categories: Tokens/coins and other digital assets (e.g., NFT, smart contracts, stoke tokens) and evaluates their credit scores. The credit score of a **Token** is assessed based on 4 parameters, i.e., (i) the token price, (ii) the market cap (MC) of the token, (iii) the token trading volume, and (iv) the number of transactions related to the token. High-credit-score tokens have a great advantage over low-credit-score tokens. Once being used as collaterals, they offer high loan-to-value ratios to borrowers; lenders also get favorable lending interest rates with their high-credit-score tokens. Users can improve their credit scores once they possess those high-valuable digital assets.\nTRAVA.FINANCE also performs credit ratings for other **digital assets such as NFT**. The credit scores for NFTs are estimated based on the number of times that they have been auctioned on TRAVA.FINANCE or other trusted platforms. NFTs’ scores should not depend on their price because their price is typically determined in an unreliable manner, based on the emotion and the preference of customers.\nTo evaluate credit scores for a wallet address, TRAVA.FINANCE credit scoring model will take into account the following factors:\n * _Total asset_. The total asset represents the financial strength of the wallet address; it is the most intuitive and easiest-to-evaluate parameter. It is also the second most important parameter that affects credit scores. The total asset is the sum of balance and total investment minus total liabilities. The credit score of the address is proportional to its total asset. As this parameter is a volatility index, the credit score is calculated based on both the _average total asset_ in a certain period and the _total current asset_.\n * _Transaction history_. Transaction history is the most important parameter; it has a major impact on credit scores. TRAVA.FINANCE collects and aggregates all exchanges, loans, deposits, and other transactions of the wallet address across multiple DApps to calculate various intermediate parameters such as (i) the age of the address, (ii) its transaction amount, (iii) its frequency of transaction, (iv) its number of liquidations and (v) its total value of liquidations.\n * _Loan ratios_. Loan ratios (debt ratios) represent the debt position of the account. It is divided into two sub-parameters, i.e., loan-to-balance ratio and loan-to-investment ratio.\n * _Circulating assets_. This parameter represents how active users are in the crypto market. The more money they invest in the crypto market, the more creditworthiness they gain from others. This parameter is evaluated based on 2 sub-parameters, (i) investment-to-total-asset ratio and (ii) ROE (Return on equity).\n * _Trustworthiness of possessing assets_. The last parameter for credit rating is the trustworthiness of the assets owned by the wallet address. The wallet can improve its credit score by possessing high-value and trustworthy digital assets. At present, TRAVA.FINANCE evaluates two types of digital assets only (i.e, Token and NFT).\n\n\nPreviousCross-chain IdentificationNextCollateralized NFTs\nLast updated 3 years ago\nWas this helpful?\n"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/whitepaper/credit-score-evaluation"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""**Introduction**\nIn borrowing, when a borrowers’ health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value, a liquidation process might happen.

Liquidity Mining— 40.0%, Marketing— 22.0%, Foundation— 20%, Listing— 2.0%, Team— 10%, Advisors— 6.0%.\n Figure 5: TRAVA Token Overview\nThe native digital cryptographically-secured fungible token of TRAVA.FINANCE (Trava token) is a transferable representation of attributed governance and utility functions specified in the protocol/code of TRAVA.FINANCE, and which is designed to be used solely as an interoperable utility token on the platform. Trava token is issued based on Binance Smart Chain’s BEP20 standard.\nTrava token is a functional utility token which will be used as the medium of exchange between participants on TRAVA.FINANCE in a decentralised manner. The goal of introducing Trava token is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on TRAVA.FINANCE, and it is not, and not intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public (or a section of the public) as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt; nor is it designed or intended to be used by any person as payment for any goods or services whatsoever that are not exclusively provided by the issuer. Trava token does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will Trava token entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. Trava token may only be utilised on TRAVA.FINANCE, and ownership of Trava token carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use Trava token as a means to enable usage of and interaction within TRAVA.FINANCE.\nTrava also provides the economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to contribute to and participate in the ecosystem on TRAVA.FINANCE, thereby creating a mutually beneficial system where every participant is fairly compensated for its efforts. Trava token is an integral and indispensable part of TRAVA.FINANCE, because without Trava token, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on TRAVA.FINANCE. Given that additional Trava token will be awarded to a user based only on its actual usage, activity and contribution on TRAVA.FINANCE and/or proportionate to the frequency and volume of transactions, users of TRAVA.FINANCE and/or holders of Trava token which did not actively participate will not receive any Trava token incentives.\nTrava token is used in 4 main areas: (1) Reward (2) Collateral & Lending (3) Payment (4) Staking:\n  1. **Reward:** To incentivise users to provide liquidity to pools, pool owners can set up rewards paid in TRAVA token.\n  2. **Collateral and lending:** TRAVA tokens may be used as the basic collateral for loans and mortgages.\n  3. **Payment for lending fees:** As the native platform currency, TRAVA tokens may be used to pay for lending fees in TRAVA.FINANCE pools.\n  4. **Payment for pool management:** As the native platform currency, TRAVA tokens may be used by pool owners to pay for pool management by TRAVA.FINANCE.\n  5. **Payment for auction deposits:** In the NFT auction process, TRAVA tokens can be used as the deposit for purchase transactions.\n  6. **Payment for auction organization:** The NFT’s owners (auction organizers) may pay for auction fees with TRAVA tokens.\n  7. **Staking for a validator:** The data stored on the knowledge graph chain must be verified by validators. As an indication of commitment and service standard assurance, validators would be required to put up an amount of Trava token as a security deposit (i.e. a \""stake\"") before being entitled to participate in the ecosystem. Where validators commit offences (e.g. incorrect information, unacceptable down-time, or other malicious acts), this stake may be slashed.\n  8. **Staking to participate in the governance process:** The Trava token would allow holders to create and vote on on-chain governance proposals to determine future features of TRAVA.FINANCE, with voting weight calculated in proportion to the tokens staked (the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of TRAVA.FINANCE; it does not entitle Trava token holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, its affiliates, or their assets or the disposition of such assets to token holders, or select the board of directors of these entities, or determine the development direction of these entities, does not constitute any equity interest in any of these entities or any collective investment scheme; the arrangement is not intended to be any form of joint venture or partnership).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCirculating supply\nTRAVA.FINANCE tokenomics highlight a strong commitment and focus for the long term development.

""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/governance/dao"",
""content"": ""Governance v1

For version 1 of Trava Governance, we present evolution in governance processes with on-chain features enabled.
Governance Process

The governance process consists of 2 continuous processes: off-chain & on-chain.

    Off-chain process:

In the off-chain process, anyone in the Trava community can raise their opinions and discuss ideas of how the protocol can improve by creating TRC - Trava Request for Comments on the Trava Forum.

After an idea is well-formed, a community member can follow our template for TIP - Trava Improvement Proposal and post on the forum for details feedback. We recommend off-chain voting (powered by snapshot.org) to gain exposure and rough consensus from the community to increase the chance of succeeding in the on-chain process.

When a TIP gets to its final version, the DAO Committee is in charge of the review process and officially proposes on-chain.

    On-chain process:

When a TIP is proposed on-chain, it becomes transparent on the public blockchain; anyone possessing voting power can directly vote for or against this proposal.

After the voting period, a TIP will be queued and executed by the public.

The Security Advisory Board acts as a guardian to prevent malicious actions and security exploits in this process.
Governance Authority

In governance version 1, the DAO will have authority over the Trava lending protocol. The community will have to agree on any significant changes or updates through the on-chain process.
Governance Power

To gain governance power, holders need to lock their Trava or rTrava token in exchange for the veTRAVA token, which holds voting power. This vote locking mechanism encourages users who show a solid commitment to the protocol with more governance power and incentive.""

""content"": ""In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol.
Trava Governance Version 1

In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc.

In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including:

    Discussion: In this stage, Trava holders will discuss different problems on the Trava Forum.
    Proposal: On this forum, once a person brings his or her ideas to the platform, the community will determine whether they should be considered by up-voting this proposal. If the community approves, it will be brought on the snapshot in the next step.
    Voting off-chain on the snapshot: On the snapshot, users will vote for the proposition they want.
    Voting on-chain: After the voting on the snapshot, the whole governance process will then be generated totally on-chain.
    Execution: After the stage of making the decision, there are two scenarios. If the proposal is accepted, it will be executed; otherwise, it will be canceled.

In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: the amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time.

Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features:

    Democracy: The voting enforcement process is democratic and transparent.
    Connectivity: The community members can recommend, discuss, and manage the products and the development direction of the Trava Ecosystem.
    Up-to-date: The community members can recommend the latest technologies and features based on the market trend that help the whole system make changes to the protocol for the best result.

The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2

Trava is the first one that allows users to create and manage their own lending pool. In the future, governance will play a significant role in the initialization movements and their operation in the future.

In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process.

Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.""

      ""content"": ""**Trava Governance — The Vision Of Trava Protocol**\nPublished in\n4 min readApr 8, 2022\nShare\n _Trava Finance (or TRAVA) is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. After more than seven months of launching the Trava Lending pool, it is now deployed on three chains (BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Fantom), and supports above 15 assets._\n_Based on this stepstone, we plan to enrich the utilities continuously in 2 main directions:_**_Trava Governance_** _and_** _NFT-Collateralization_** _for the lending pool._\n \n**_The long-term vision with Trava Governance_**\nWith Trava Governance, we provide our users with decision-making power. By doing so, we gather the crowd’s wisdom and give users the chance to speak up and have the authority for the whole community’s benefit. In the future, we would like to transfer completely the management decision to our users — our community. We believe that community is the key to creating real value for our project.\nIn addition to decision-making on our operational and benefit-sharing plan, Trava Governance is determined to be a perfect stepstone for those who desire to be pool owners in our lending protocol in the future, as it is a useful process for pool owners to evaluate their decisions for running our lending pool. Thus, this improves their decision-making capacity and helps them make better decisions for their own lending pool in the future when the pool creation function is activated.\nIn the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol.\n \n**_Trava Governance Version 1_**\nIn version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool.

Governance Process  The governance process consists of 2 continuous processes: off-chain & on-chain.      Off-chain process:  In the off-chain process, anyone in the Trava community can raise their opinions and discuss ideas of how the protocol can improve by creating TRC - Trava Request for Comments on the Trava Forum.  After an idea is well-formed, a community member can follow our template for TIP - Trava Improvement Proposal and post on the forum for details feedback. We recommend off-chain voting (powered by snapshot.org) to gain exposure and rough consensus from the community to increase the chance of succeeding in the on-chain process.  When a TIP gets to its final version, the DAO Committee is in charge of the review process and officially proposes on-chain.      On-chain process:  When a TIP is proposed on-chain, it becomes transparent on the public blockchain; anyone possessing voting power can directly vote for or against this proposal.  After the voting period, a TIP will be queued and executed by the public.  The Security Advisory Board acts as a guardian to prevent malicious actions and security exploits in this process. Governance Authority  In governance version 1, the DAO will have authority over the Trava lending protocol. The community will have to agree on any significant changes or updates through the on-chain process. Governance Power  To gain governance power, holders need to lock their Trava or rTrava token in exchange for the veTRAVA token, which holds voting power. This vote locking mechanism encourages users who show a solid commitment to the protocol with more governance power and incentive.', 'In the long-term, we’ll improve two versions of Trava Governance. Version 1 allows users to decide on Trava Lending pool development as its operation and adjustment direction. In version 2, besides the benefits received in the first one, users gain a substantial right to take responsibility for managing the initialization of the users-owned lending pools and the operation and interaction among these lending pools in Trava protocol. Trava Governance Version 1  In version 1, based on the D.A.O. structure, Trava finance enhances community engagement by letting users make decisions about the operation of the Trava Lending Pool. For example, these users will determine what assets should be put in or what collaterals are allowed in the lending pool, etc.  In this case, there are five stages of gradually improving the new model, including:      Discussion: In this stage, Trava holders will discuss different problems on the Trava Forum.     Proposal: On this forum, once a person brings his or her ideas to the platform, the community will determine whether they should be considered by up-voting this proposal. If the community approves, it will be brought on the snapshot in the next step.     Voting off-chain on the snapshot: On the snapshot, users will vote for the proposition they want.     Voting on-chain: After the voting on the snapshot, the whole governance process will then be generated totally on-chain.     Execution: After the stage of making the decision, there are two scenarios. If the proposal is accepted, it will be executed; otherwise, it will be canceled.  In this process, the decision-making rights are based on two main factors: the amount of locked TRAVA/ rTRAVA and the period of locking these tokens. Specifically, users need to lock their Trava token to ensure their loyalty and responsibility to the project. They’ll have voting power if they do that; the more Trava they lock, the more power they attain. This voting power also corresponds with the locking period thus it will be lessened over time.  Implement the new model as Trava Governance; we want to build a strong community with three key features:      Democracy: The voting enforcement process is democratic and transparent.     Connectivity: The community members can recommend, discuss, and manage the products and the development direction of the Trava Ecosystem.     Up-to-date: The community members can recommend the latest technologies and features based on the market trend that help the whole system make changes to the protocol for the best result.  The Future scope — Trava Governance Version 2  Trava is the first one that allows users to create and manage their own lending pool. In the future, governance will play a significant role in the initialization movements and their operation in the future.  In version 2, users could also have on their hand the right to decide the sharing revenue proportion. We plan to apply the new version of Trava Governance in Quarter 3 this year. Once it is implemented, users could exchange the voting power by buying or selling them on a secondary marketplace. Users have another gateway to attain voting power for participating in the TRAVA governance process.  Users who participate in Trava Governance Version 1 will have the right to decide the development process of Trava Governance Version 2.']"

""content"": ""What is veTRAVA?

To fulfill the “decentralized” part of the Trava Decentralized Marketplace, we launched Trava Governance, based on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model, to give users decision-making power. In this case, veTRAVA, in the form of NFT, represents this power and is determined by the time and amount of locked tokens (as they show your commitment toward the future of Trava Finance).

With the implementation of the Trava Governance Vault, users can lock their TRAVA, rTRAVA, and LP TRAVA/BNB into this vault to receive a certain amount of veTRAVA representing their powers: the more veTRAVA you own, the higher your voting power in the Trava ecosystem.
The Benefits Of Owning veTRAVA

The key value of veTRAVA is its representative of users’ power and their commitment to the project. As a result, in the long term, users who own veTRAVA can receive significant benefits:

    Deciding on crucial parameters such as LTV, risk parameters, etc., in the lending pools (Trava Lending Pool and Users-owned Pools).
    Receiving share profit coming from the fee charged by borrowers
    Receiving boosting rewards in rTRAVA by providing liquidity and holding veTRAVA at the same time.
    Earning TRAVA reward: the APR will be revealed soon.

As mentioned, veTRAVA is utilized as a form of NFT. For now, it can only be available for those who lock their token into the Governance Vault. However, it will be exchanged peer-to-peer with the launch of veTRAVA Marketplace.
veTRAVA Marketplace: Overview

As its name suggests, the veTRAVA marketplace is for users to buy and sell their veTRAVA. It means they can freely exchange their voting power. The main reason we came up with this idea is to optimize users’ experience, bringing them as much freedom as possible. It’s the “Decentralization” we are heading for.

Besides bringing more freedom to users, veTRAVA Marketplace increases liquidity for veTRAVA and thus benefits both sellers and buyers. In more detail, buyers can buy veTRAVA (voting power) easily on Marketplace and then earn voting power immediately. In this case, the remaining locking time will be more flexible, no longer limited to a particular period set in the Governance Vault. When it comes to sellers, they can easily utilize crypto assets in a more liberal way and get benefits from it.
The Influences of veTRAVA Marketplace

veTRAVA Marketplace is an important feature that contributes to the development of Trava Governance. As mentioned above, users who hold many veTRAVA will have a crucial role in the decision-making process of the Trava Finance ecosystem. The veTRAVA holders can alternate the voting results, and through the Marketplace, users can buy or sell the voting power with others.

With the fact that users can trade their voting power to each other, anyone in the ecosystem will have a chance to vote for the changes they want to make in Trava Finance. The more users have veTRAVA, the more voting power is distributed, and users will be given the full power to make the decisions that can affect the Decentralized Lending Marketplace, which will elevate the decentralized side of Trava Finance’s ultimate goal.""

      ""content"": ""**Does Trava apply NFTs in the ecosystem?**\nYes, TRAVA allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract.\n \n\n**How does Trava price NFTs?**\nTrava will provide the auction function for NFT assets. Thus, the NFT's owners can open an auction session to price the NFT. The auction winner can buy directly the NFT or he/she can join in a collateral smart contract by locking their NFT's payment. In this way, we can price, and put NFT into the lending process. Besides, our approach also helps increase the liquidity for NFT because the asset can be used in the lending business in an easy way. We also avoid the price fluctuation of NFT because the NFTs have been priced in the auction contract before.\n \n\n**What can I do with NFTs after the auction?**\nTRAVA.FINANCE auction mechanism is divided into two modes: auction-to-sell and auction-for-buy-right. The difference between two modes is the ownership of the digital asset after the auction. In the auction-to-sell mode, as soon as the auction ends and the auction winner pays the fee, he/she will immediately receive the auctioned NFT.\nMeanwhile, in the auction-for-buy-right mode, the winner cannot immediately buy the digital asset. After a certain amount of time specified in the auction, if the NFT owners cannot repay the loan, the auction winner can buy it at a low price. Otherwise, they get a considerable interest if the NFT owners repay the loan and get their NFT back.\nPreviousTrava Credit ScoreNextListing\nLast updated 2 years ago\nWas this helpful?"",

Health factor is an indicator which is used to evaluate the level of safety of your collateral assets against the borrowed assets and its underlying value. You should keep this indicator as high as possible because the higher the value is, the safer your loans are against liquidation scenarios. The liquidation of your deposits will be triggered if the health factor reaches 1. And if the health factor is below 1, your collateral can be liquidated. The health factor is determined depending on the liquidation threshold of your collateral against your borrowed funds.
What is the meaning of health factor fluctuation?

The health factor increases or decreases depending on the value fluctuation of your deposited amount. Your health factor increases is a positive indicator, it will improve your borrow position and protect your collateral far from being liquidated.

Audit Scope

The audit focused on the following considerations:

    Testing the smart contracts against both common and uncommon attack vectors.

    Assessing the codebase to ensure compliance with current best practices and industry standards.

    Ensuring contract logic meets the specifications and intentions of the client.

    Cross-referencing contract structure and implementation against similar smart contracts produced by industry leaders.

    Thorough line-by-line manual review of the entire codebase by industry experts

Findings:

There are seven issues found in total, including 1 Minor Finding, 2 Informational Findings, and 4 Major Findings.

Firstly, one Minor and Two Informational Issues concern some coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused functions, missing zero addresses checking, and function type. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.

Secondly, all four Major Issues are related to Centralization. The owners of the following contracts below can execute some functions without obtaining the consensus of the community:

    FactoryRegistry,

    AddressesProviderFactory

    PoolUpdateControl

    LendingPoolConfigurator 

Certik Recommendations for the Centralization Issue:

Certik advised to carefully manage the governance/guardian account’s private key to avoid any potential risks of being hacked. In general, Certik strongly recommended centralized privileges or roles in the protocol to be improved via a decentralized mechanism or via smart-contract-based accounts with enhanced security practices, e.g. Multisignature wallets.

Some feasible solutions recommended by Certik that would also mitigate the potential risk include:

    Time-lock with reasonable latency, i.e. 48 hours, for awareness on privileged operations;

    Assignment of privileged roles to multi-signature wallets to prevent a single point of failure due to the private key;

    Introduction of a DAO/governance/voting module to increase transparency and user involvement.

Trava Solutions for the Centralization Issue

Trava has partially resolved these issues via smart-contract-based accounts. In particular:

    Deploy a Multi-Signature wallet in BSC mainnet at the address: 

0xdF73aC573Dfd430f4C5558B8CbeD86e86145501B

    Set up the owner of the contracts and governance to the multi-signature wallet.

Although these issues are major, our approach can avoid the potential risks of centralization. Moreover, in our roadmap, we will enable DAO Functionalities in Q2–2022. The introduction of the DAO module will completely resolve the centralization issues. This approach will make our community control the process and activity of Trava Finance in the near future.""

This thorough security audit checked and ensured the following imperative points as 2 main Categories (1) Code review (2) Functional.

The audit report contains all found security vulnerabilities and other issues in the reviewed code. As a result of the audit, There are no critical issues in our contracts. Besides, Hacken’s security engineers found 4 high, 4 medium, and 3 low severity issues. Overall, after the auditing process, Hacken evaluated Trava’s contracts as Well-Secured (the highest level of security as the assessment).
Severity High

There is one issue regarding the implementation function and three issues regarding uninitialized state variables:

    Issue 1 (unimplemented function): The logic of function finalizeTranfer has commented-out unimplemented logic. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.

    Issues 2, 3, 4 (uninitialized state variables): Some state variables are not initialized for the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager but they are being called.

        Trava’s Response: We consider the contract LendingPoolCollateralManager as a Logic Contract where we execute our code by using delegate call from LendingPool Contract. That explains why we don’t initialize the state for that variable.

        Following the verification, Hacken determined that these are not issues.

Severity Medium

There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to unused imports, Not checked contract address, and No event on lendingPoolConfigurator change. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.

There is one Issue concerning Possible FlashLoan attack in the LendingPool contract. Despite the fact that we do not believe this attack could happen in real life, we took great care in resolving the problem.

Description: IF both of TToken and its underlyingAsset are traded on multiple DEXes and have different rates there could be a FlashLoan attack. Attackers could FlashLoan a TToken, and process withdraw, which will give then the exact same amount of the underlyingAsset, and then calling deposit, they will receive the same amount of TToken.

Having the 1-to-1 “exchange” on the LendingPool and different rates on DEXes, attackers could “play” with the market many times in one transaction until they receive enough rewards. The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.

The same would work to borrow methods. So anyone could borrow without having assets but FlashLoaning them.

Hacken’s Recommendation: Consider some restrictions like minting/returning assets in the next block only.

Trava’s solution: Token transfer restrictions for transferring in the same block where minting occurred.

After the verification, Hacken concluded that the issue had been resolved completely.
Severity Low

There are three Issues concerning coding styles and Gas Optimization. They relate to Unused state variable, public/external function, Unused function argument. We heeded the advice and resolved these issues.""

Explain EXP and how can I use it for Farming,docs,"[
{
""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/nfts/exp-points"",
""content"": ""At the moment, EXP (Experience Point) is the point that shows how long an Armoury NFT is staked in our vaults. EXP is the parameter indicating the loyalty of NFT owners in our Farming Program. In the near future, EXP will be calculated in various ways apart from the length that NFT is farmed in our vault.

Currently, EXP of each Armoury NFT will increase when their owner assembles them to a Knight NFT and deposits Knight NFT in one of five vaults to farm. For every second of the Knight NFT in the vaults, EXP is added by 1. Therefore, after 1 hour EXP will increase by 3600 points. And the EXP will remain the same if it is withdrawn out of the vault

We’ve already calculated EXPs for your NFTs at the time of opening the Farming Program. EXP in a collection (Trava Knight NFT) will be averaged based on the EXP of 4 Armoury NFTs (items).

You can see your EXP  either in the Inventory tab, Collection section or on Trava NFT Marketplace.

Normally, when you open chests to gain Armoury NFTs and assemble them into a Knight NFT. You farm your Knight NFT in our vault, all those Armoury NFTs are given the same EXPs. However, when you withdraw your Knight NFT, disassemble and reassemble with different items to get another Knight NFT, your Armoury NFTs will have different EXPs.

For example: You open 4 chests and get: Helmet, Shield, Armour and Weapon. You assemble them into a Knight NFT and farm in our vault. After 24h, the EXPs for Armoury NFTs are as follow:

    Weapon EXP: 86400

    Shield EXP: 86400

    Armor EXP: 86400

    Helmet EXP: 86400

So EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow:
(86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400
(86400+86400+86400+86400)/4=86400

After 24h, you withdraw your Knight NFT to reassemble with Armoury NFTs you buy on Trava NFT Marketplace. Suppose, those Armoury NFTs you bought have been already farmed in vault before and have the EXPs as follow:

    Weapon EXP: 86400

    Shield EXP: 100000

    Armor EXP: 320000

    Helmet EXP: 210000

Thus, the EXP of Knight NFT (collection) is as follow:
(86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100
(86400+100000+320000+210000)/4=179100

There will be a lot of benefits for NFT owners to have high EXPs. The more EXP you have, the more value the NFT will be. This can help you to distinguish NFT value from other NFTs of the same type and rarity. Moreover, the EXP will be applied in our Trade-up Mechanism which will be launched soon. In the future, EXP will be used with Credit Score and applied to NFT-collateralization. It can be said that EXP is an important factor in Trava Knight NFT to reach our goal of collateralization.""

""content"": ""Heuristic Farming (Farming based on EXP)

When the new Farming mechanism commences, our 5 current Farming vaults will stop distributing TRAVA as reward, which means our 5 existing vaults will only give back EXP (one EXP for each second in 5 current farming vaults). This change supports NFT owners to gain EXP to enter Heuristic Farming with better rewards.

In the new Farming mechanism, we provide  5 more vaults for Heuristic Farming, and you can deposit as many knights as you want into each Vault, provided that those knights have the same rarity as that Vault. Rewards from Heuristic Farming are rTRAVA tokens and EXP (one EXP for every 3 seconds in the vault). The higher EXP, the higher the APR, the higher the rTRAVA reward.

Normal Farming

Heuristic Farming

Number of vaults

5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities

5 vaults corresponding to 5 rarities

Number of Knights allowed in one vault

1 Knight

≥≥1 Knight

Reward in tokens

None

rTRAVA

EXP reward

One EXP is released for each second Knights in the vaults

One EXP is released for 3 second Knights in the vaults

With the new and improved mechanism, the EXP points are a crucial element in the development of the Trava Knight NFT journey. Like the current Farming mechanism, Heuristic Farming also has a Polishing mechanism. The polishing mechanism in Heuristic Farming helps NFT owners maintain 100% rewards and supports increasing EXP and APY.

Note that, Knights with 0 EXP still gain rewards from Heuristic Farming. Moreover, with rTRAVA from Heuristic Farming, users can auto-stake in our rTRAVA with no locking period in our Staking Program. rTRAVA then can be locked in Trava Governance vault to gain locking power as veTRAVA and earn more rewards.

Backing per TOD is the dollar value of each TOD token based on the backing reserve.\n**Backing Reserves** Backing Reserves is the sum of all reserve assets' RFV value from the treasury.\n**Bond Installment** Installment bonding is one of the regulations of TraDAO, which allow users to pay partly in a certain time when buying bonds; they don’t have to pay all in one go. They can deposit bonds to auto-compound vaults to earn rewards and payout original debt plus corresponding interest debt.\n \n\nC \n**Circulating Supply** The best approximation of the number of TOD tokens circulating in the market and in the general public's hands.\n**Current Index** When users stake TOD, they will receive xTOD tokens. The index value represents the conversion ratio between TOD and xTOD. At the initial state of the protocol, the index is 1.0, which means the conversion is 1:1. The index will increase through the rebase process to track how much users’ TOD balance has increased from auto-compounding reward. Index will never decrease, only increase.\n \n\nD \n**DAO** Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a governance mechanism for making decisions in a more trustless and collaborative way.

TOD supply increases when minted by Treasury only:\n 1. TOD is minted and distributed as stakers’ rewards.\n 2. TOD is minted from bond revenues whenever someone purchases a bond: - TOD is minted for bonders when they redeem after the vesting period and unstake. - TOD is minted for DAO, determined by a rate set by the policy team.\n\n\n**Total Value Staked** The total value staked is the number of TOD tokens users staked in the staking contract, multiplied by TOD’s price on the market.\n**Treasury** The treasury is a basket of assets (e.g., BUSD, DAI, TOD-BUSD LP…) to back the value of TOD.\n**Treasury Balance** Complete name is the market value of treasury assets.

While vesting, your TOD tokens are automatically staked. There is two types of vesting terms:\n * Fixed expiration: vesting time will be the time difference between the time of purchasing until the bond closes. If the bond is vested at 10:00 AM, March 14, any notes purchased can be redeemed after that time.\n * Fixed term: vesting time will always be a duration set per bond. If the vesting is 7 days, you can redeem it exactly 7 days after buying it.\n\n\nPreviousAnalytics GlossaryNextTrava Governance Glossary\nLast updated 1 year ago"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://docs.trava.finance/glossary/tradao-glossary"", ""rrf_score"": 0.08928571428571427 }, { ""content"": ""**Ticket for Battle Hand** A special program for Trava Battle Hand's hosts allowing them to get Tickets as rewards besides the winning bets\n**Ticket for Expedition** A utility of Trava Tickets allowing users to boost success rate and rewards, EXP, while joining Trava NFT Expedition\n**Ticket for Treasure Map** A utility of Trava Tickets allowing users to access the Trava Treasure Map (1 ticket needed for each term) and earn Reward Tickets\n**Ticket in exchange for Chests** One of the most critical utilities of Trava Tickets allowing users to exchange 10 Tickets for one chest\n**Ticket Marketplace** A place where users can come to buy or sell Tickets, and it supports peer-to-peer transactions, in which sellers can determine the Ticket prices and buyers can freely choose the suitable prices to buy, and applies the Liquidity Pool mechanism, including swapping and providing liquidity, so that users can gain additional profits.\n**Ticket Staking Program** A special 1-month program allowing users to stake presale tickets and earn high rewards with APR from 150% to 1500%\n**Ticket/TRAVA** Pool A liquidity pool in the Ticket Marketplace allowing users to provide liquidity or swap TRAVA and Tickets \n**Trava Counter** A place where users can buy/sell Counter Tickets to the protocol at 80% of the current counter price and sell Incentive Tickets.

What is Token Health and how can it measure a crypto risk?,blog,"[

""content"": ""What is Token Health?

Token Health is an index to evaluate the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava is the world-first lending platform that provides this index by collecting and aggregating various types of data from blockchain networks. The health of each token is evaluated as a specific value in the range of [0; 1000]. This health index gives the users a comprehensive overview of tokens in the cryptocurrency world and thus facilitates TRAVA lending and other DEFI businesses.
Original features in Trava Token Health

Standardizing value for each indicator: There have been a few projects providing information on tokens such as Coingecko, CoinMarketCap, LunarCrush, CREAM Finance, DMM Exchange, etc. They typically present multiple types of on-chain data represented by raw numbers only. For example, they show the market capitalization of tokens but do not standardize those values, which makes it harder for users to understand the meaning of the values or make a comparison among different tokens. Performing standardization for the numeric indicators, Trava allows users to quickly assess different tokens in terms of MarketCap, Trading Volume, Token Price, etc.

Aggregate all indicators into a single index: Similar projects simply present multiple token indicators to users without combining them into a single index to make a comprehensive assessment of tokens. Trava Token Health Model, which is a user-oriented model, has been built to address this inconvenience by computing those separate indicators and combining all of them into an insightful index, i.e., Token Health. Users can use this single value to evaluate the health of a token and can quickly decide to invest in the token or not.

Utilizing both absolute and relative indicators: The absolute indicators are commonly used in many token-analyzing projects, while relative values are typically being overlooked. The absolute and separated values do not provide many complete insights, as those values ​​are not correlated with each other. Different from other projects, Trava makes use of both absolute and relative indicators to evaluate the Token Health in the most precise and overall manner. Let us take an example with tokens A and B. The trading volume of token A is $100M, while that of token B is $10M. People tend to quickly jump to the conclusion that token A outweighs token B with regards to the trading volume. However, when considering the market cap of the two tokens, it shows that the MarketCap of token A is 1000 times greater than that of token A. Thus, in the correlation with the MarketCap, the trading volume of token B is in fact much more impressive than that of token A. The example shows that, by combining absolute and relative indicators, Trava Model provides more comprehensive insights compared with related projects.

Customized UI for each user: The UI for Trava Token Heath can be customized for individual preference. Trava provides users with the leaderboard of all tokens, ranked by the total score (i.e., Token Health) or other single indicators such as market cap, token price, and trading volume. Users can access the historical charts of each indicator to get more insights. Moreover, what makes Trava Token Health special compared to the related projects is that Trava enables users to customize the charts based on their preferences. For example, they can add their favorite tokens with their preferable indicators in a single chart to compare and evaluate multiple tokens in an easy, time-saving, and elegant manner.

Various types of indicators: The Trava Token Health model is constructed based on various parameters in different aspects of DeFi. There are seven main parameters; all are selected and analyzed under a strict process before being deployed to ensure the most reliability and creditworthiness. In addition to the absolute values, we also calculate and analyze the relative values such as: the price over the highest score or the trading volume over the MarketCap. We also consider the fluctuation of the values over time. The detailed model will be presented in the next section
Trava Token Health model

Trava has studied and developed an exclusive token rating model. The model takes into account various types of data. At present, the data is grouped into seven main indicators including (1) Market cap, (2) Number of transactions, (3) Volume of transactions, (4) Number of holders, (5) Distribution of tokens to holders, (6) Price, and (7) Price stability. Each indicator in turn is evaluated based on several sub-parameters.
The use of Trava Token Health

One of the significant benefits of Token Health is to reduce risks. When participating in the crypto world, users have to face many types of risks such as token price crashes or collateral liquidation when borrowing. Token Health will be a useful tool for users to minimize these risks. They can determine which tokens should not be invested at certain times to avoid risks. Let us take an example of how two major risks can be addressed by Trava Token Health:

    Risk of token liquidity. In the DeFi field, price fluctuations can result in risks of loan liquidation for both the pool owners and liquidity providers. With Trava Token Health, the pool owner can choose stable price tokens to allow performing actions in the pool to avoid this risk.
    Risk of token inflation. Tokens with high inflation are more likely to have a price crash. Users in DeFi can suffer significant losses due to such crashes. With Trava Token Health, users have a full overview of token price, using our price stability indicator, the price over the highest score, or the Token Health index. This information is an effective tool for users to avoid the risk of tokens’ price crashes.

Moreover, Trava Token Health assists users to make optimal decisions on token investing. In the past, choosing which tokens to invest, lend or borrow, was a major problem for users in the crypto world because there was no credible basis for them to assess the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Trava Token Health allows users to observe the history of multiple token indicators and the overall Token Health index to be more confident when making their investment decisions.""

      ""content"": ""**Technical Update: Beta Version of Trava Token Health**\nPublished in\n5 min readOct 6, 2021\nShare\n \nAlpha Version glimpse back\n**Token Health** is the innovative index developed by Trava to evaluate the creditworthiness and stability of tokens. Unlike other models, Trava standardizes the numeric value of each indicator into the range of [0;1000] and then aggregates all indicators into a single index. This helps users to easily evaluate the token and make investment decisions promptly. Moreover, Trava uses both absolute and relative calculation when assessing indicators to increase the precision and accuracy of Token Health.\nThe Trava Token Health model is now built on 7 indicators, including: (1) Market Cap, (2) Number of transactions, (3) Trading volume, (4) Number of holders, (5) Distribution of tokens to holders, (6) Price, and (7) Price stability. It is a helpful tool for users to minimize the risks related to token price and liquidity. Trava also allows users to observe the history of the seven indicators and the overall Token Health index so that they can easily make their investment decisions.\nRead more about Trava Token Health .\n \nUpdate for Beta Version\n**Number of tokens being enriched**. Trava Team has upgraded the Token Health from Alpha Version to Beta Version with significant features. Trava extracts and enriches data on a large number of tokens from different blockchain networks. So far, we have evaluated the health of tokens on 3 blockchains, including 370 tokens on Ethereum, 376 tokens on BSC and 5 tokens on Polygon. Moreover, during the analyzing process, we aggregate data of the original token and its pegged tokens on other blockchain networks. For example, when calculating the trading volume of ETH, we take into account the trading volume of both ETH and Binance-Peg Ethereum Token on the BSC network.\n**Easily understandable written reports being generated**. As a great update for the Alpha Version, we now provide users with automatically written reports for tokens. Rather than spending time on complicated values which require a strong knowledge and experience in the crypto field, users now can understand the token with ease. The written reports are very helpful for both experts and crypto newbies to effortlessly apprehend the practical meaning hidden behind the statistical indicators. Users no longer need to worry about doing complicated analyses themselves as the Beta Version of Trava Token Health has already assisted them in the whole process and satisfied their information needs.\n**Recommendations for trading actions**. There is a substantial improvement needed to be pointed out in the Beta Version. Along with the written reports of a token, we now are able to make recommendations to users on their trading actions. Available actions suggested by Trava Token Health are: buy, not buy, sell, not sell, deposit, and withdraw. Those actions are recommended to users with an insightful review and thorough analysis. Users can use the suggestions as additional references before arriving at any major decision.\n**Definition and history of indicators being added.** This version of Token Health also provides the meaning of each indicator to support users more effectively. The history of every indicator is available as well, so that users can get a comprehensive overview of their concerning tokens.\n \nFuture scope of Token Health in Trava Lending Pool\nThough having many considerable improvements in this version, we are continuing to upgrade Trava Token Health and we will apply it in the Trava Lending Pool. Lenders and borrowers will be equipped with strong support in lending and borrowing actions. We can recommend to users which tokens they should lend, which ones they should borrow and which ones are good for collateral. Pool owners can also use our token reports and check the history of the token to make good decisions on which tokens they should add to their pools. Trava Team will work harder to generate more comprehensive and insightful token reports that are able to help newbies master their crypto world.\n \nUI\nGo to the site: https://scoring.trava.finance/tokens-health\nIn the Health Overview Token, you will see the radar chart presenting 7 different scores for 7 indicators: Market Cap Scorem Price Over Highest, Daily Tc Score, Volume Score, Holders Score, Distribution Score and Price Stability Score; and one single aggregated index — Health Score. At the right of the chart, you will see the Token Health History which allows you to assess the whole history of Token Health of one specific token. Under the chart, there is “Analyze token”, this function will automatically generate a written report for the token providing you with the analysis you need.\nWhen you click on “Analyze token”, a detailed analysis report together with suggestions from our team will be displayed, which is a very useful reference for you to make your investment decisions.\nIn this version, we also add the meaning of each indicator to help users with deeper understanding."",

These events could be an attempt to manipulate the market by centralized factors, the effort to attack the protocol, or other unexpected situations.\n \n**Why do we need a Security Advisory Board?**\nIn the world of blockchain, the biggest thing is users’ trust in a protocol based on their development potential and strong security.\nAlthough blockchain technology is secure, decentralized, and distributed, the risks still remain in many forms, especially in cryptocurrency. In fact, DeFi hacks are on the rise. Digital thieves had a big year in 2021, taking $3.2 billion in cryptocurrencies. This number is predicted to be even higher in 2022. In the first three months of this year, hackers have stolen $1.3 billion from exchanges, platforms, and private entities.\nFor that reason, we need to prepare for unexpected issues. As a long-term vision, Trava will soon implement the Trava Governance and go ahead with building an entire decentralized marketplace where the users are responsible for developing the protocol themselves.\nAt first, users with voting power will decide on critical terms of the Trava Lending Pool, such as adding or removing assets, changing the risk parameters, etc. In the long-term, these responsibilities are widened and affect the users-creation pools as well.\nDespite the advantages of a decentralized autonomous organization, especially in collecting the crowd’s wisdom before making a decision, this model brings the risks of being attacked or manipulated by a centralized entity, etc.\nTo be more specific, if most governance tokens are in the hand of centralized parties, it would be possible for a governance attack to occur where a centralized entity uses its users’ voting power to take over the governance proposals and voting.\nIn that case, it is necessary to have a group of people who can solve the problem quickly and effectively enough to prevent the worst scenario and consult reasonable strategies for avoiding the risks.\n \n**What are the primary roles of SAB?**\nAs mentioned, this group of people is responsible for the security of the Trava Governance, which is implied in some main points:\n * First, providing quick solutions for unexpected issues relating to the dramatic fluctuation of the market and hacking actions.\n * Second, recommending the strategy for improving the governance security.\n\n\n \n**Who are they?**\nGiven the crucial role of the SAB, in the beginning, this team combines experts who also take responsibility for the development of the Trava Ecosystem as a whole.\nWe would like to introduce the SAB team as below:\n * Mr. Minh Nguyen — CEO & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Duc Tran — Head of Security & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Thang Nguyen — CTO & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Quan Dinh — CPO & Co-founder of Trava Finance\n * Mr. Chung Dao — Strategy Advisor of Trava Finance- CEO & Co-founder Oraichain\n\n\nFirst, the security advisor board includes five people from the team, as mentioned above.

""content"": ""What is TRADAO?

TRADAO is the world’s first protocol supporting multi-chain deployment in DeFi 2.0, and also Web 3.0 compatible. TraDAO is protocol owned liquidity (POL), accumulating value through such activities of bonding and auto-compound staking which are regulated by Trava Treasury. As a product in Trava ecosystem, the liquidity owned by TRADAO protocol could be deposited in Trava Lending Pool to generate more profit and this profit will be shared among users in the entire Trava ecosystem.

TRADAO Protocol will issue a decentralized reserve currency — called TOD. The concept behind TOD token is that it is backed by a basket of assets in Trava Treasury that ensures it does not fall below its base value of $1. The TOD token will be released based on the “Mint & Burn” mechanism, managed by no one other than TRADAO protocol.
Why is TRADAO different compared to other OHM forks?

In comparison to other initiatives in the DeFi 2.0 space, TRADAO Protocol offers a number of unique advantages to users.
How does it work?

Our Bonding allows users to buy TOD at a discounted price compared with exchanges in other assets such as stablecoins, LP tokens, and so on. The number of TOD tokens that the bonder is entitled to will be vested in a certain term.

Bond Installment is a one-of-a-kind feature that allows users to buy more TOD with a little initial amount of assets, then leverage benefits in Staking Strategy, and pay off the debt. Your bond shall be automatically staked after you use Bond Installment.

Wallet Reputation will be integrated with this product in the form of a reference to decide which user will have more benefits (i.e, lower prepaid rate, lower interest fee rate, higher liquidation discount rate,…). For example, holding assets in the Trava Ecosystem can be considered as a condition to gain a high wallet reputation.

Our Staking allows bonders to stake their TOD token in our auto-compounding vault and earn rebase rewards, after receiving TOD tokens from bond sales. The rebase rewards are also from bond sales held in Trava treasury, or profit of the protocol.""

""content"": ""We are opening two public offering rounds to give our loyal users as well as our new investors more opportunities to take part in the TraDAO Protocol at the very first stage. In both rounds, participants will buy $TOD tokens in BUSD. The details of two rounds are as the table below:

To get off to a good start, Trava will contribute to TraDAO Protocol with $50,000 worth of 20,000 $TOD tokens. This support is to ensure initial liquidity of $TOD and show the commitment of Trava team in developing TraDAO protocol, thus bringing trust to our community and staying the true ideology of Trava since the beginning, that is a fair launch project and independent of any whale or VCs. The funds from sale will be used to back the $TOD sold and provide initial liquidity after listing.

If we are 100% subscribed, the sale will bring in $345,000. $105,000 will be deposited to the treasury to back initial supply. The remaining $240,000 will be added as liquidity. The LP will open on PancakeSwap with 240,000 BUSD and 20,000 $TOD, in addition to 85,000 $TOD from Public Offering and contribution of Trava Team. This means the starting price of $TOD is $12, and total initial liquidity on Pancakeswap is $480,000 of both tokens. Thus, the total Initial Supply of $TOD will be 105,000 $TOD.
How can I join Public Offering?

We will also open two (02) Rounds of Whitelist, which will then be merged to one Final Whitelist at the end. The two rounds open to welcome new Knights and incentives for Loyal Knights in the TRAVA ecosystem as follows:

    Whitelist Round 1 (will be live on Jan 21st) — Power up TRADAO — To welcome new members into TRAVA Ecosystem
    Whitelist Round 2 (will be live on Jan 28th) — Cheer up Trava Knights — To honor TRAVA loyal users

Participants in the Final Whitelist will have a lucky ticket in buying $TOD Token at the cheapest price before it hits the official launch on PancakeSwap. When you buy, you are removed from the whitelist; if some people buy less than their share, everyone who has not yet bought will get a higher allocation. The details of each Round will be released in our next announcements.

After the public offering rounds, we plan to open two strategies of Bonding and Staking for users to leverage their rewards and earn profit from them. We also have a plan to allow Bond Installment and Wallet Reputation for Bond purchases, which creates a perfect gateway for users with small funds to invest and profit from the protocol.""

It encourages users to build their own reputation and get special offerings and more benefits.\n_Wallet Reputation will be officially launched at_** _3.00 P.M UTC January 24th_** a _nd will be used to select participants in Whitelist round 2 for Public Offering._\n \nWhat is Wallet Reputation?\nWallet reputation to a set of token T (i.e., wallet T-reputation) is a parameter to evaluate the loyalty of holders to the tokens in the set, showing the trust and reputation of the holder in the community. A holder who owns a large number of tokens over a long period will have a high reputation.\nIn TraDAO Protocol, TRAVA, rTRAVA, farming TRAVA and farming rTRAVA are the tokens used to determine Wallet Reputation. TRAVA and rTRAVA are tokens kept in wallets of holders while farming TRAVA and farming rTRAVA are held in our vaults or that users deposit TRAVA and rTRAVA respectively. In the future, we will also add TOD token to evaluate the wallet reputation.\n \nBenefits of high Wallet Reputation?\n**_Lucky Tickets in Whitelist for TraDAO Public Offerings_** : Wallet reputation shall be used in selecting participants in one of two Whitelist rounds for Public Offering of TOD tokens. Users with a higher reputation will have a better chance of being whitelisted and getting the best deal on TOD.\n**_Incentive Discounts in Bond Purchases/Exchanges:_** The typical benefit for reputable wallets is the discount on bond programs. Moreover, wallet reputation could also be integrated with our Bond Installment to offer high-reputation wallets more benefits such as lower prepaid rate, lower interest fee rate, higher liquidation discount rate, etc.\n**_Other incentives in TRAVA Ecosystem such as TRAVA NFT Marketplace:_** Wallet Reputation also has a lot of room to expand and connect data from Trava Knight NFT and bring NFT owners a great profit.\n \nHow does it work?\nIn the initial version, the reputation tracking system is implemented based on the rules on time and balance. Generally, the larger the number of tokens a user holds or stakes for a certain period, the higher reputation rank the user will hold. There are five reputation ranks, from 1 to 5, where the fifth rank is the best one. Assume N is the minimum number of TRAVA, rTRAVA, farming TRAVA, and farming rTRAVA a wallet holds during the period of time from t1 to t2. Each rank Ri is associated with a threshold Ni. The reputation rank of the wallet is decided as shown in the following table:\n**_For example_** , for N1= 150,000; N2 = 300,000; N3 = 500,000; N4 = 1,000,000; N5 = 10,000,000, a user holding 2,000,000 TRAVA for the period of 15 days would be at rank 4 and another one who holds 750,000 TRAVA in this period of time will be at rank 3.\n \nNotes:\n * Since wallet reputation is determined over a period of time, the more TRAVA, rTRAVA, farming TRAVA and farming rTRAVA you hold as long as possible, the higher reputation rank your wallet will be, the more benefit you will get.\n * The tracking system, the threshold values, and the rules can be modified according to each bond program. Those are determined through the DAO."", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-wallet-reputation-pioneering-feature-in-reputation-tracking-474281641a02?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----84-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.07142857142857142 }, { ""content"": ""**Key notes**\n * Eligible whitelisted wallet addresses will be announced on 25th Jan\n * The Public offering round 1 will take place from Feb 4th, and Public offering round 2 is on Feb 9th\n * The Public offering currency is BUSD\n * The price of TOD token in two Public offerings and other details can be found \n * The details for round 2 of the Whitelist will be announced on Jan 26th"", ""image_ids"": [], ""filename"": null, ""url"": ""https://blog.trava.finance/introducing-tradao-whitelist-round-1-c32fe90e78bf?source=collection_home_page----75e285c42203-----86-----------------------------------"", ""rrf_score"": 0.0625 } ] }",False,False,False,False,FALSE,False,,,,"['https://blog.trava.finance/introduction-to-tradao-protocol-a-breakthrough-into-defi-2-0-d549c782422c', 'https://blog.trava.finance/tradao-public-offering-announcement-eda810f6cb2']","['What is TRADAO?  TRADAO is the world’s first protocol supporting multi-chain deployment in DeFi 2.0, and also Web 3.0 compatible. TraDAO is protocol owned liquidity (POL), accumulating value through such activities of bonding and auto-compound staking which are regulated by Trava Treasury. As a product in Trava ecosystem, the liquidity owned by TRADAO protocol could be deposited in Trava Lending Pool to generate more profit and this profit will be shared among users in the entire Trava ecosystem.  TRADAO Protocol will issue a decentralized reserve currency — called TOD. The concept behind TOD token is that it is backed by a basket of assets in Trava Treasury that ensures it does not fall below its base value of $1. The TOD token will be released based on the “Mint & Burn” mechanism, managed by no one other than TRADAO protocol. Why is TRADAO different compared to other OHM forks?  In comparison to other initiatives in the DeFi 2.0 space, TRADAO Protocol offers a number of unique advantages to users. How does it work?  Our Bonding allows users to buy TOD at a discounted price compared with exchanges in other assets such as stablecoins, LP tokens, and so on. The number of TOD tokens that the bonder is entitled to will be vested in a certain term.  Bond Installment is a one-of-a-kind feature that allows users to buy more TOD with a little initial amount of assets, then leverage benefits in Staking Strategy, and pay off the debt. Your bond shall be automatically staked after you use Bond Installment.  Wallet Reputation will be integrated with this product in the form of a reference to decide which user will have more benefits (i.e, lower prepaid rate, lower interest fee rate, higher liquidation discount rate,…). For example, holding assets in the Trava Ecosystem can be considered as a condition to gain a high wallet reputation.  Our Staking allows bonders to stake their TOD token in our auto-compounding vault and earn rebase rewards, after receiving TOD tokens from bond sales. The rebase rewards are also from bond sales held in Trava treasury, or profit of the protocol.', 'We are opening two public offering rounds to give our loyal users as well as our new investors more opportunities to take part in the TraDAO Protocol at the very first stage. In both rounds, participants will buy $TOD tokens in BUSD. The details of two rounds are as the table below:  To get off to a good start, Trava will contribute to TraDAO Protocol with $50,000 worth of 20,000 $TOD tokens. This support is to ensure initial liquidity of $TOD and show the commitment of Trava team in developing TraDAO protocol, thus bringing trust to our community and staying the true ideology of Trava since the beginning, that is a fair launch project and independent of any whale or VCs. The funds from sale will be used to back the $TOD sold and provide initial liquidity after listing.  If we are 100% subscribed, the sale will bring in $345,000. $105,000 will be deposited to the treasury to back initial supply. The remaining $240,000 will be added as liquidity. The LP will open on PancakeSwap with 240,000 BUSD and 20,000 $TOD, in addition to 85,000 $TOD from Public Offering and contribution of Trava Team. This means the starting price of $TOD is $12, and total initial liquidity on Pancakeswap is $480,000 of both tokens. Thus, the total Initial Supply of $TOD will be 105,000 $TOD. How can I join Public Offering?  We will also open two (02) Rounds of Whitelist, which will then be merged to one Final Whitelist at the end. The two rounds open to welcome new Knights and incentives for Loyal Knights in the TRAVA ecosystem as follows:      Whitelist Round 1 (will be live on Jan 21st) — Power up TRADAO — To welcome new members into TRAVA Ecosystem     Whitelist Round 2 (will be live on Jan 28th) — Cheer up Trava Knights — To honor TRAVA loyal users  Participants in the Final Whitelist will have a lucky ticket in buying $TOD Token at the cheapest price before it hits the official launch on PancakeSwap. When you buy, you are removed from the whitelist; if some people buy less than their share, everyone who has not yet bought will get a higher allocation. The details of each Round will be released in our next announcements.  After the public offering rounds, we plan to open two strategies of Bonding and Staking for users to leverage their rewards and earn profit from them. We also have a plan to allow Bond Installment and Wallet Reputation for Bond purchases, which creates a perfect gateway for users with small funds to invest and profit from the protocol.']"
